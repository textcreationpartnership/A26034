            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Wiſdom and Grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus, are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Scripture expreſſed by the name of Riches and Treaſures. Theſe it is the duty of Believers in all Ages, diligently to ſearch after, to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and poſſeſs for themſelves. And it may be, more Diligence or with more Succeſs, as unto the doctrinal Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, hath not been uſed in this Enquiry in any Age, than in that wherein we live. But ſtill they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <hi>Unſearchable,</hi> though not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely as unto their Truth, Reality and Subſtance, or ſuch a poſſeſſion of them as may enrich us unto a Meetneſs for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; but
<pb facs="tcp:48427:3"/> as unto their unmeaſurable Dimenſions, their Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height in Degrees of Fullneſs. Wherefore, after the utmoſt and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearch made into theſe things by the beſt and wiſeſt of the Sons of men, there is ſtill and ever will be, new work for the Church whilſt it is in this world, to enquire farther after and into theſe Treaſures. Nothing but the ſight of Chriſt himſelf in Glory, can give us a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of them. Whilſt we are here below, no man can exerciſe his ſpiritual Wiſdom and Faith, about a more noble, a more uſeful, and beneficial object. They do beſt for themſelves who are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant herein, and will be ſound to be the moſt ſpiritual and thriving Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And therefore thoſe who are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe for themſelves herein, but do more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over communicate unto others the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they have obtained of theſe <hi>unſearchable Treaſures,</hi> and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
<pb facs="tcp:48427:3"/> into them, that they alſo may be made Partakers of them, do deſerve well in an eminent manner of all that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Among theſe, the reverend Author of the enſuing Diſcourſe (if I miſtake not) doth deſerve our Praiſe and our Thanks to God for him and his Labours. For as he hath given Evidence, that he was himſelf in a good meaſure, admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enjoyment of theſe <hi>unſearchable Riches;</hi> ſo he hath with great skill and ſpiritual wiſdom, unfolded and laid them open unto the view of others. And this he hath done ſo briefly, plainly, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically, that the moſt learned will find nothing in his Diſcourſe to be deſpiſed, and the generality of Believers, whoſe Edification he deſigned, will meet with that which will be to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The times alſo wherein we live, do render this and diſcourſes of the like Nature exceeding ſeaſonable. For the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty of the continuance of all
<pb facs="tcp:48427:4"/> other Riches, ſhould ſtir us up to look with diligence after an indefeaſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the certain and <hi>unſearchable Riches</hi> of Chriſt. For as theſe alone are ſufficient for us in every Condition, ſo we know not but that e're long, they alone will be left unto us; bleſſed are all they who are poſſeſſed of them. Beſides, the Oppoſition that hath been made of late by ſome unto theſe and the like Myſteries of the Goſpel, doth give a value unto a ſober Teſtimony given unto them. Of this Nature is the enſuing Diſcourſe, which that it may be uſeful to the Reader, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the ends whereunto it was deſigned by it's worthy Author, ſhall be the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Servant in the work of the Goſpel.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Occaſion of this Diſcourſe, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the Words, and Explication of them, and the main truth contained in them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>RICHES are deſired by moſt, but true Treaſures obtained by few, (through the miſtaken Notion thereof.) 'Tis ſad to ſee how ſollicitous many are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vanities: and (like the Jews in <hi>Egypt)</hi> are ſcattered abroad, through all the Land, to gather Stubble, whilſt tryed Gold lies neglected; and the Pearl of Price little valued. O the Projects and vaſt expence of Time and ſtrength to reach things
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48427:5"/> that are not; when the infinite Concerns of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and welfare of an immortal Soul, cannot get a room in one ſerious thought; or a few minutes of ſhortening time to attend them. 'Tis lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to behold, not only the blind World, but thoſe that profeſs themſelves Wiſe, (like the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) working out their Bowels to weave Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs, and (with the Dog in the Fable) letting go the Subſtance to catch at Shadows; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves out of breath to ſit down in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The affecting ſenſe of this Folly hath made me ſcatter ſome Balls of true Gold to prevent (if poſſible) the dangerous haſte of ſuch deceived Souls, and to allure them to better and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Treaſures, that are to be found in, and fetched from the Lord Jeſus. This is the Deſign of the enſuing Diſcourſe on this portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I ſhall briefly open, and then draw forth the main Concluſion I intend to proſecute.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle layes down theſe words as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by which he endeavours to ſtrengthen the Faith of thoſe believing <hi>Epheſians</hi> in, and to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their Affections to the Goſpel of Chriſt, taken from the bleſſed Advantages it brings to all that do receive it. It makes a Diſcovery and overture of unſearchable Riches to them: let them be never ſo poor, deſtitute of the affluences and good things of this World; yet, by believing through this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, they ſhall come to attain to ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; even the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the Words you have four parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Diſcovery of the admirable Love of God to fall'n man, particularly to the blind, periſhing Gentiles, in not only giving Chriſt to ſave them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48427:5"/> but in opening Chriſt to them, even his ſecret and boundleſs Treaſures: <hi>The unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Here's the way by which theſe are opened and brought to light, which is, by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in the Adminiſtration thereof by his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: That I ſhould preach [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, 'tis to preach the Goſpel, or good news, but generally it takes in the whole work of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here's the great expence of Grace the Lord Jeſus is at to bring forth his unſearchable Riches, 'tis by the laying out of Grace to thoſe that publiſh it <hi>(To me who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this Grace given;)</hi> Grace, great Grace, to the leaſt of Saints, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) leſſer, leaſt, or more little than the leaſt; an unuſual Degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man's ſelf, and the Character of an empty and unworthy Inſtrument in his own eye, and ſo a Subject that needed much Grace, to be meetned for ſuch high Service: and yet ſuch a one did Chriſt uſe in this great Work, laying out large Grace to prepare him for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another conſiderable part of the words, are the Perſons for whom this Grace is given, and to whom theſe unſearchable Treaſures are diſcovered, and they were Subjects moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, <hi>(to the Gentiles)</hi> the chiefeſt of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, blind idolatrous Souls, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the Heathen, Perſons extremely wicked, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32. called Beaſts, wild Beaſts, Strangers to God, beyond the Line of Communication, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Aliens from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, yea, Enemies to God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48427:6"/> in their minds; to thoſe did the Lord lay out theſe unſearchable Treaſures.</p>
               <p>To clear up my way to the main truth I intend to proſecute hence, and to leave no difficulty in the words, 'tis neceſſary I ſpeak to three things, by way of Explication.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In what ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, ſeeing he was a Perſon ſo dignified by Grace to be a choſen Veſſel to God, an Apoſtle of Chriſt, fill'd with the Graces of the Spirit, and eminent Endowments for the Miniſtry, beyond many, taken into ſuch high Communion with Chriſt, let into the third Heavens to ſee things unutterable; How then can <hi>Paul</hi> truly call himſelf leſs than the leaſt of all Saints? Does not <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak diſſemblingly, as the Pope does, when he calls himſelf <hi>Servus Servorum,</hi> the Servant of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and yet makes himſelf Lord over the Faith and Conſciences of others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer, Paul</hi> doth not hyperbolically debaſe himſelf here, but really, and in the deep ſenſe of his former Vileneſs, before Converſion, when he perſecuted the Church, and blaſphemed Chriſt; in the conſideration of which, he thought none like him: never ſuch a Wretch as he did God advance to ſo high Dignity to be an Apoſtle of Chriſt: nor doth he think that any particular Saint was ſo guilty in that kind and degree of wickedneſs as he was: one that kick'd againſt the pricks, perſecuted Chriſt in his Members, haling Him to Priſon, ſeeking to draw out his very heart blood, and to root out the profeſſion of him: Now for ſuch a one as he to obtain this Grace, to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, and to have ſuch
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48427:6"/> Treaſures of Grace imparted to him, he thinks that Chriſt never did the like Favour to any ſo vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a Creature as he was: ſo baſe will a Child of God be in his own eyes, when once the Lord ſets his Sins in order before him. <hi>Paul,</hi> in another place, calls himſelf the chiefeſt of Sinners, greater than the greateſt of Sinners, but never leſs than the leaſt of Sinners. Indeed compar'd with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, his Sin ſeemed leſs than their Perſecution and Blaſphemy, in the degree and nature of it; his was ignorantly, theirs was maliciouſly perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, (and ſo the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt) and in that reſpect his Sin was leſs than theirs, but compar'd with any that were ſaved, he thought himſelf really leſs than any of them in regard of his ſinful Life before Converſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What is this Grace which <hi>Paul</hi> ſo admires, and by which his Condition is ſo changed, and he enabled to preach thoſe Unſearchable Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, By Grace here is underſtood that infinite Favour and free Grace of God to him through Chriſt, by which he was called out of the ſtate of Sin and Death into the Knowledge and Kingdom of God; that ever the Lord ſhould pitch on ſuch a vile Wretch as he, and chooſe him to be a Veſſel of Mercy, revealing his Son, with his Unſearchable Riches, to ſo poor and unworthy a Creature, pardoning his great Tranſgreſſions, and pouring out his infinite Treaſures on him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By Grace in this place, ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Apoſtleſhip which he obtained at the hand of Chriſt, and the Miniſtry he received to preach to the Gentiles theſe Unſearchable Riches
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48427:7"/> of Chriſt: ſo is it rendred <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>By whom we have received Grace and Apoſtleſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hereby is meant alſo thoſe excellent Gifts he had received for this end; thoſe choice anointings of the Spirit, and Revelation of the Myſtery, to ſo poor and ſcandalous a Creature as <hi>Paul</hi> had been, and one that was ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Chriſt and Salvation; that God ſhould make him ſuch an able Miniſter of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and give him any door of utterance, and Endowments fit for ſo glorious a Service. This is that Grace by which theſe Treaſures were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be opened here is, What are thoſe Unſearchable Riches of Chriſt which <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the Gentiles, and which are held out in the Goſpel unto Saints and Sinners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Thoſe Riches which are in Chriſt, as Mediatour, with which he is enriched in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; thoſe unſpeakable Excellencies of his Perſon, which, though they reſide and inhere in himſelf, yet they contribute abundantly to the Riches of Believers, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>In whom are hid all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge,</hi> (ſubjectivè) as his Treaſures, found in him. All Treaſures, created and uncreated, are not ſimply placed in him, but hid ſo, that they can be known by none but thoſe to whom they are revealed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here are intended thoſe Riches that came by Chriſt, the Riches of his Purchaſe, the vaſt Eſtate which he hath bought for all Believers, for all that come unto him by Faith, the Eſtate which he gives, makes over, and prepares for ſuch, and this is called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſearchable Riches:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48427:7"/> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Riches that cannot be found, or traced out. A Metaphor taken from quick ſcented Hounds, that are yet at a loſs, and can go no farther: ſo the moſt illuminated Creature cannot follow home theſe Riches of Chriſt, they are ſo myſterious that they cannot be diſcovered; they leave no Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps for any to go after them: the beſt are at a ſtand and can go no farther, when they come to wade into this Deep, ſo deep and hidden are theſe Riches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If the Riches of Chriſt be ſo unſearchable and paſt finding out, How then could</hi> Paul <hi>diſcover and preach them out to the Gentiles? If they are not to be traced out, then Miniſters cannot open them, nor Hearers underſtand them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, They are undiſcoverable by any Humane Eye; the moſt refined Light of Nature cannot diſcern them; they are Treaſures that no natural Abilities can reach: the moſt profound Learning, and deepeſt Studies of the wiſeſt men on Earth, can make nothing of them; they are no way known but by Revelation and unveilings of the Spirit; and in this ſenſe are called Unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to the fulneſs of their Worth and Excellency, they cannot be underſtood by any in this Life; no mortal man, no unglorified Soul can know them as they are: to caſt up the total value of theſe Treaſures, is beyond the Arithmetick of Saints themſelves; nay, Men and Angels cannot underſtand the things that God hath prepared, that Chriſt hath purchaſed for them that love him: <hi>Here</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>we know in part, and we propheſie in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>We,</hi> both you and I,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48427:8"/> the moſt elevated Light, by this ſide Glory, know nothing of theſe lock't-up Myſteries as we ought: and on this account alſo they are Unſearchable.</p>
               <p>The Words being opened, and the Cabinet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock't, I come to the main Subject, and Treaſure laid up in them; which you may take in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Doctrine and Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>There are exceeding great, glorious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches in Chriſt, opened and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to Sinners in the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Doctrine lie three grand Aſſertions to be proved.</p>
               <p>Aſſertion 1. <hi>That there are exceeding great, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unſearchable Riches in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aſſert. 2. <hi>Theſe vaſt and hidden Treaſures of Chriſt are opened in and by the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aſſert. 3. <hi>'Tis the Will of God that all theſe great and glorious Treaſures, which are in, and come by Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould be open'd and offer'd to Sinners, yea, the chiefeſt of Sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak to each Aſſertion, but more largely to the firſt: <hi>That there are exceeding great, glorious and unſearchable Riches in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I ſhall firſt prove by Scripture, That there are great, glorious and unſearchable Riches in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Shew you (according to the Grace given me) what are thoſe Unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there are ſuch Riches in, and come by Jeſus Chriſt, the whole Goſpel atteſts, which is a Revelation of the Excellency of Chriſt, and thoſe glorious things which come by him. I ſhall give you three or four Scriptures to prove it;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48427:8"/> 
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this myſtery among the Gentiles; which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi> In the former verſe the Apoſtle calls the Goſpel a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery hid from former Ages; the Excellency of which he opens in this verſe, and ſets out in theſe two Epithetes,
<list>
                     <item>1. Rich.</item>
                     <item>2. Glorious.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, 'Tis a rich Myſtery, in that it opens the glorious Riches of Chriſt, which are better than the Gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> and all precious Subſtance; the Riches of his Wiſdom, Grace, Righteouſneſs and Redemption, which he calls tryed Gold, and counſels poor Sinners to come to him for it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis a glorious Myſtery; called the Riches of his Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>That he might make known the Riches of his Glory on the Veſſels of Mercy.</hi> Eph. 1. 18. <hi>The Riches of his Glory, &amp;c.</hi> The Goſpel is a glorious Myſtery, becauſe it brings to light great and glorious things, even the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of unknown Glory: and what theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Glory are, he tells you in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>they are Chriſt in you the hope of Glory:</hi> Chriſt Jeſus applied by Faith, and received into the Soul by the Spirit, is this glorious Treaſure, in that he gives them (in his Union with them) an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Right to Glory. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 18, 19. <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> are aſcribed to him: <hi>Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour are with me, yea, durable Riches and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: My Fruit is better than Gold, yea, than fine Gold, and my Revenue than choice Silver.</hi> This is ſpoken of Chriſt, the true Wiſdom of God, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. Chriſt the Wiſdom of God, and Power
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48427:9"/> of God) who is the Subject of this Chapter. And 'tis ſaid of him, that <hi>Riches, durable Riches,</hi> are with him, better Treaſures than Gold, than choice Silver; Durable Treaſures, which Time can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not waſte or alter; Riches that laſt to all Eternity, which Ruſt and Moth cannot conſume. And <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs (i. e.)</hi> Treaſure juſtly gotten, Riches of Wiſdom and Grace given him by the Father, and Riches of Righteouſneſs bought by his Blood. All this Treaſure is in him, and offer'd by him unto Sinners. In Chriſt muſt needs be Unſearchable Riches, <hi>for in him dwells the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, Col.</hi> 2. 9. that is, the Divine Nature united to the Humane Nature: perfect God, as well as perfect Man; the infinite Treaſures of the Divine Nature are his. <hi>He is the Heir of all things,</hi> and therefore muſt needs be rich. Heaven and Earth are his, Jews and Gentiles, all Perſons and Things put under him; in which Glory and Majeſty, ſet over all the Works of Gods hands, he mounts his Throne (having confirmed his Title by his Blood) and gives Gifts to men, and makes a tender of Grace and Glory, of Thrones and Crowns, to all that come unto him, promiſing to his Servants, that they alſo ſhall inherit all things, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. and therefore he himſelf muſt needs be rich. In him are Treaſures of Mercy and Goodneſs, of Wiſdom and Knowledge, Riches, exceeding Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Riches of Strength, Honour, Glory and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. So that the Scriptures give in full teſtimony to this Truth, That there are exceeding great, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and unſearchable Riches in Chriſt. And now I ſhall endeavour to ſhew,</p>

               <p> Secondly, What are thoſe exceeding great and unſearchable Riches of Chriſt. But alas! this Well is deep, and wherewith ſhall we draw? theſe Treaſures are out of ſight, who can find them out? they are boundleſs, bottomleſs, numberleſs, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; where ſhall we begin? where can we make an end? who can ſearch them out to Perfection? The beſt of men are but Learners, the Angels are Enquirers, the wiſeſt men but Fools in theſe Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; we can know but in part, nor propheſie but in part; when the utmoſt is ſpoken, you have not heard of one half of his Glory. But according to the Revelation of Chriſt, I ſhall open ſome of theſe Treaſures of Chriſt to you, under theſe two Heads, His

                  <p>The Perſonal Riches of Chriſt opened, in his Divine Nature; manifeſted in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; with the wonderful Advantages thereof to Believers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>PArt of theſe glorious Treaſures of Chriſt lies in his Perſonal Riches, that vaſt Worth and unknown Excellency that reſide in himſelf, which become the Believers Treaſure alſo, by their Relation to, their Union with, Contemplation of

               <p>Now theſe Perſonal Treaſures of Chriſt are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, in his Natures, in his Offices, in his ſweet and gracious Diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>In his Natures ſeverally conſidered, and united in his Hypoſtatical and Perſonal Union. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt conſiſts of two Natures,

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48427:10"/> in Subſtance, equal in Power and Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Of whom concerning the Fleſh Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever:</hi> over all men, and over all things; or in all, (as <hi>Vatab.)</hi> This Scripture is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed by all Interpreters to prove the Divine Nature of Chriſt. He is God over all, and bleſſed for ever, in himſelf, and of himſelf: and the Author of all thoſe Bleſſings his Creatures enjoy. <hi>By him are all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, Viſible and Inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, all things were created by him and for him,</hi> Coloſſ. 1. 16. And therefore he is perfect God, this being his peculiar Operation to create the World: <hi>By him all things conſiſt; he upholds all things by the word of his Power,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. Supporting and ruling them, which is another property of the Divine Nature, the ruling and bearing up of all things in the World, which none but everlaſting Arms can do. So he hath Power to forgive Sins, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God can do: to raiſe the Dead, to judge the World, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 5, 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 43, 44. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. To know the Secrets of all Hearts, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 22. To be the Object of Religious Worſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 16. All which abundantly prove the Lord Jeſus to be perfect God: and ſo of infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Bleſſedneſs, to inrich all that come unto him; which will evidently appear, if we do but a little conſider thoſe Perfections of the Divine Nature, as opened in the Scriptures, all which are in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, His Simplicity, being a moſt pure Eſſence without the leaſt Compoſition or Diverſity of Parts or Accidents. There is no mixture of Qualities or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48427:11"/> Excellencies in God, but every Attribute is his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Eſſence, and therefore he is a moſt pure and ſimple Being, as the Names he gives himſelf import, eſpecially theſe two, <hi>Ehejeh, Exod.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>I am hath ſent me unto you.</hi> The Word is in the future Tenſe, <hi>I will be, hath ſent me;</hi> but in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the future Tenſe expreſſeth often both the Preſent and preterperfect; and ſo this Word holds forth God's moſt ſimple, abſolute, and immutable Being and ſelf Exiſtence. So <hi>Jehovah,</hi> a Name which God ſeems to take moſt Delight in, and which doth as it were ſum up all his glorious Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in one word, importing his moſt pure, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and incomprehenſible Eſſence, which he hath in and from himſelf, before all time, and unto all Eternity, ſubſiſting in, and of himſelf, and giving Being to all his Creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be the moſt perfect and ſimple Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Unity of his Eſſence proves his Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, he is one God (though three Perſons) <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4. Hear <hi>O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one God;</hi> he is the firſt Being, and one undivided Eſſence, and therefore moſt pure and ſimple. He is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a moſt perfect Being, in and of himſelf, who wants nothing that is excellent, nor can have any thing in himſelf that is evil, and therefore is a moſt ſimple, pure Nature.</p>
               <p>And if Jeſus Chriſt, as God, be ſuch a ſimple and excellent Being, then he is a moſt perfect Treaſure to his People; there is nothing wanting in him to make them happy, nor can there be any thing in him or come from him to make them miſerable; then he is true and faithful to Believers; there can be no Contrarieties in him, or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48427:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> proceed from him; his Love is ſincere, his Purpoſes are true, there is a reality in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for he is one, and of one mind to his redeemed ones. O Believers! think on the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt's Nature, the Perfection of his Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Integrity of his Affections, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs of all his Perfections, to make his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ones happy. There's no Moth, or Ruſt, no Worm or Death, can ware out his pure Affections to his People. There is no mixture in his Nature: Compoſition is the Corruption, or Imperfection of created Beings, but in Chriſt's Divine Nature there is Unity and Simplicity, there is nothing can alter his Thoughts and Reſolutions to his ſincere ones: he is moſt true, and moſt full in all his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and this his Simplicity: aſſures Believers of eternal and infinite Bleſſedneſs in their Union with, and Relation unto him, for he is in himſelf the moſt abſolute and perfect Being, the firſt and moſt ſimple Being: he is moſt perfect in and of himſelf, for he hath all his Perfections in and of himſelf (as God) and all that is ſufficient for his infinite Bleſſedneſs, in and from himſelf, and hath all that in him, which is ſufficient for the Good of his Creatures, and higheſt Happineſs of his People. Again, he is moſt perfect, becauſe he wants nothing from another to make him bleſſed. He needs no Creatures to contribute any thing to him, nor doth he loſe any thing by Creatures fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him: or can have any Addition to his Glory or Bleſſedneſs, by the acceſs of men, or Angels to him. So alſo, he doth what pleaſeth himſelf, nothing can reſiſt his Will, or fruſtrate his Purpoſes, and therefore is moſt perfect in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48427:12"/>
               <p> And if the Lord Jeſus be ſo perfect in himſelf, then he is the Author of Perfection to his People, for he hath made over himſelf, his whole Perſon, God-Man, to Believers, to be their Shield and exceeding great Reward. Then Believer, thy caſe is happy, thy Treaſure is full and perfect, thy Choice is a bleſſed Choice, and thy Lot a perfect Lot, fall'n in a good Ground. Then the Perſon of thy Beloved is altogether lovely, his Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being altogether perfect, not a Spot or Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in him. Then all his Gifts to his Spouſe are perfect, his Righteouſneſs is a perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that makes Believers in God's Account as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as Chriſt himſelf, were not the robe of his Righteouſneſs every way as large as thy Guilt and Nakedneſs, were it not long enough and broad enough to cover all thy Deformities, and hide all thy Imperfections from the pure and judging Eye of the Father, it were not perfect. But all his Procurements by his Blood are perfect. His Holineſs is a perfect Holineſs, and he will make his Peoples Graces perfect too, e're he hath done. <hi>He is the Rock, his Work is perfect, i. e.</hi> He doth perfectly fulfill his Promiſes, his Works are true to his Word, <hi>and he will perfect that which concerns his People. Pſal.</hi> 138. 8. <hi>i. e.</hi> He will accompliſh that which he hath begun in me.</p>
               <p>Let the doubting Believer know, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Chriſt is Security for Perfection in his Graces alſo, in due time; he that hath begun a a good work in thy Soul, will perfect it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt; he will, e're he hath done, bring thy weak Graces to Perfection, that when he ſhall appear to Judgment, thy Holineſs ſhall be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48427:12"/> preſented to the Father without Spot or wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Godhead of Chriſt, is a moſt pure and ſimple Being, ſo is he an infinite Eſſence, both internally, without all Limitation or Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Being; and externally, without all Comprehenſion of Places or Capacities; every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of his is infinite, <hi>His <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Pſal.</hi> 147. 5. His Wiſdom, Power, Love, Mercy, Faithfulneſs, and all his Perfections, are one entire, infinite Being, that cannot be known or compriſed, no Bounds or Meaſures can be ſet to his divine Excellencies, <hi>The Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 27. or compaſs his Greatneſs; how much leſs can a narrow Heart receive his Fulneſs, his Love: and all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are beyond Knowledge. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 25. <hi>To whom then will ye liken me, or ſhall I be equal, ſaith the holy one.</hi> This Infiniteneſs of Chriſts divine Nature, is a myſtery too deep for humane Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to fathom, not curiouſly to be ſearched out, but humbly to be ador'd, and no way diſcoverable, but by his own Light, and according to the model of a created underſtanding. Some dark Reflections of this viſible Glory, are diſcoverable in the Glaſs of ſacred Scripture, which declare the Greatneſs of God, both as to his incomprehenſibleneſs and Eternity; he is every where, and yet circumſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed no where, he fills all places in the World, or without the World, but confin'd no where; no where included, no where excluded: containing all things, contained by none, his eſſential Preſence is in all places, not by any Extenſion or Diviſion of parts, which are not in God, but (as the Soul
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48427:13"/> in the Body, ſo is God in the Univerſe) the whole in the whole, and the whole in every part; He is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially preſent in all Places; not by imparting his Eſſence to any created Being, but by giving and preſerving the Being of thoſe things which fill up thoſe Places: ſo his Power is every where, in that all things are ſubject to his Power; his Wiſdom fills Heaven and Earth, in that all Things and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are manifeſt in his ſight. And this yields,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Comfort to Believers.</item>
                  <item>2. Terrour to Sinners.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Wonderful Comfort to Believers, in the Aſſurance of Chriſt's Omnipreſence with them, to counſel and comfort them. The Believer can ſay, what none elſe can, Where I am, there is my Treaſure with me: In all Eſtates and Places is the Lord Jeſus with his People (while they keep with him.) In the Water, he wades with them; in the Flames, he ſtands between them, to keep off De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from them; when under Wants, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, Dangers, he is by them at their right hand to relieve them: he knows their Soul in Adverſity, for he is near them: He is by, when Corruptions inſurrect in them, when Satan with his fiery Darts aſſaults them, or Enemies oppreſs them; he ſees when their Fears riſe and their Tears fall: He ſtands behind <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s back when he is mourning, and puts his Tears into his Bottle, and layes his Complaints upon his Heart. No ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is <hi>Mary</hi> mourning for her departed Lord, but he is by her ſide to comfort her. When his <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> are thrown into the Lyons Den, he goes with them to ſhut the mouthes of devouring Lyons, or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48427:13"/> to give Life in the midſt of Death: When the Knife is at the Throats of his <hi>Iſaacks,</hi> his Power is by to hold back the murtherous hand from deſtroying; <hi>We will break their bands, and caſt their cords from us,</hi> Pſal. 2. 3. ſay the Saints Enemies: Hold there, ſaith Chriſt, I am with them to defend them. No cruel Edicts can exile them from his Preſence: He was in <hi>Patmos</hi> with <hi>John,</hi> and turn'd it into a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion; with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the Dungeon, and gave him Goal delivery. Earthly men may be abroad, and their Treaſures at home; but faithful Believers carry their Treaſure with them, or their Portion, their Inheritance follows them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Immenſity and Omnipreſence of Chriſt ſpeaks Terrour to the Wicked, in that he is near them to behold and requite their Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; He knows their Works and their Thoughts, all their ſecret Deſigns are naked in his ſight; There's no covering from his Eye, <hi>The Darkneſs and Light are both alike to him, Pſal.</hi> 139. 12. He ſees their Rage and Fury againſt him; their hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den works of Darkneſs: All their Plots and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes againſt his Intereſt are open to his Eye: their inward Thoughts, filthy Luſts, cloſe Practiſes, are before him; he is behind thy back, Sinner, to hear thy blaſphemous Oaths, thy reproachful Slanders of his wayes and People: thy malicious reſolves, thy bloody Decrees againſt his poor and faithful ones: He is before thee to obviate thy Deſigns, to fruſtrate thy Attempts, and requite thy Spight and Miſchiefs. O you who are yet in your blood and gore of Sin, in your confederacy with Death and Hell, in your fixed Wrath againſt the Lord and his Anointed, be perſwaded to believe the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48427:14"/> greatneſs of your Danger before you feel it; think how viſible all your works of darkneſs are, when God, who is all Eye, is in every place; and how deſperate your ſinful Adventures are, on the drawn Sword of Divine Juſtice at your Breaſts; how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe your ſecureſt ſtate is, who are compaſs'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Circle of Omnipreſence, and have Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance continually at your heels, yea, are taken in the Arms of devouring Judgment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The belief of Chriſt's being every where, gives a Caution to all to carry themſelves in all Places and Undertakings, as ſuch who are ever in his ſight: His Eyes run to and fro, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Evil and the Good: He ſtands by thy Bed ſide, to inſpect thy waking Thoughts, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy unchaſte Motions, thy Earthy, vain Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations; no ſooner is a forbidden wiſh in thy Heart, but his Eye is there alſo: thy tow'ring Pride, thy pale Envy, thy flaming Anger, thy frothy Pleaſure, thy luſtful Deſires, thy revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Projects thy Earthy Thoughts, are legible Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters to his diſcerning look. And ſhould not the ſenſe of this adviſe thy rational Soul to more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over thy treacherous Heart: And ſurely, were Chriſts All-ſeeing Eye more obſerved, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Thoughts would be more weighed, and their Inſides more regarded. O, Reader, whoever thou art, Lodge this Truth in thy Heart, and carry this Belief up and down with thee, wherever thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; The Eye of God is on thee: He that muſt ſhortly be thy Judge, is now thy Recorder; and puts a Remark on all thy Thoughts, Words and Wayes, for which he will bring thee into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Set a watch on all the riſing motions of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48427:14"/> thy Heart; ſtop thy haſty words at the door, and examine what they are, whence they come, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go, before thou let them paſs; and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thy deſigned Actions by the Standard of the Sanctuary, e're thou let them go under thy hand; ſeeing he that is thy Judge comes with his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring Line to take an Account of them, and to render according to their nature and merit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Again, As Chriſts Infiniteneſs exceeds all confines of Place, ſo he paſſes beyond all termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Time; being from Everlaſting to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, without Beginning, without End: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 2. His Duration admits of no diſtinction of Time, and therefore muſt needs be Eternal. Time is the meaſure of Finite Beings, which are capable of Priority and Succeſſion, but the Divine Eſſence hath no Beginning, and ſo can have no End: He is the Author of all other Beings, and therefore cannot have a Beginning; there being nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to give him a Being: God hath his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in and of himſelf, and ſo muſt needs be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. Neither is he only Eternal, (ſaith <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas)</hi> but he is his own Eternity, becauſe he is his own Eſſence, ſubſiſting in and of himſelf; which Eſſence, or Eternity of his, is the very reaſon of Eternity, and of all things contained therein: for the Divine Eſſence, ſubſiſting of himſelf, muſt needs be before all things that are made, as the Cauſe is before the Effect, and Eternity before Time; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things that are made are made by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>His Unity alſo proves his Eternity, being one uncompounded and undivided Being, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, as Unity is before Multitude: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48427:15"/> Beings are, they are derived from Unity; and without End, for take off Unity and nothing remains. The Scriptures bear full witneſs to the Eternity of Chriſt: <hi>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadſt formed the Earth, and the World, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting thou art God,</hi> Pſal. 90. 2. <hi>I am the firſt, and I am the laſt, and beſides me there is no God,</hi> Iſa. 44. 6. <hi>He is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha and Omega, the beginning and the Ending, which is, which was, and which is to come,</hi> Rev. 1. 8. <hi>He is before all, and by him all things conſiſt,</hi> Col. 1. 17. And though Chriſt be called the onely begotten Son of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. and ſo implies the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be before the Son; yet this priority is of Order, not of Time; Chriſt, as God, is Eternal with the Father, and ſo before all Time, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. and to Everlaſting.</p>
               <p>And this greatens the Believers Happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all conception, that his Treaſure is Eternal: Time limits all the Comforts and Intereſts of Chriſtleſs Souls, let them ſeem never ſo amiable and great (through the multiplying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>glaſs of miſtaken Senſe) yet the ſhortneſs of their Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion narrows up their Felicity; whereas the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven-born Souls exceeds all Dimenſions and Terminations: The Moth of Time cannot conſume their Treaſure: their Leaſe can never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: thouſands of years, that compriſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Earthly Eſtates, ſubſtracts nothing from that Eternity, which gives duration to the Saints Treaſure. Rejoyce, O Believer, in the aſſured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of thy beſt Intereſts; here thy moſt deſired Mercies are but of ſhort continuance: Thy Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are but Tabernacle-priviledges; thy Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48427:15"/> determinable, thy Frames are tranſient, thy Pleaſures fading, Hope, Peace, Love, Grace, endures but for a Seaſon, but thy Poſſeſſions beyond the Grave, are eternal: and as long as Chriſt lives, ſhall thy Treaſure laſt, thy Holineſs, Happineſs, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Perfections in the other World, ſhall be coexiſtent with thy Soul; and as far from expiring as the Love that gave them was from beginning.</p>
               <p>And as thy Comforts here are ſhort liv'd, ſo are thy Troubles too, Sorrow enduring for a Night, light Afflictions, and but for a moment, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. Tears contained within a Bottle, Fears, Wants, Loſſes, Dangers, confin'd within this Span of time, and expir'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with this ſhort Vapor of Life, but thy Conſolations, Gain, Enjoyments, Peace, Safety, ſhall be eternal, no more liable to the Injury of time; thy wet and weary Sowings, are but for a Seaſon; thy weak and waſting Duties, will be over; but thy reaping, thy reſting ſhall know no end, but endure while the Eternity and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of Chriſt can make them good.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Divine Nature of Chriſt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable alſo, above all Alteration and Change, <hi>He is the ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and for ever. Heb.</hi> 13. 8. Immutable is his Nature, being a moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Eſſence, free from parts or any Mixture, that might render him capable of Corruption; he is alſo the firſt Being, and ſo free from the Influence and Diſpoſe of a higher Power. Change in any thing comes, either from a Corruptibleneſs in its Nature, or from the Will of a Superiour Power: but God being the firſt and ſupreme Cauſe, is above all, and ſo unalterable in his Nature. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 6. <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt.</hi> He is infinite too, and ſo comprehends all Fullneſs of Perfection in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48427:16"/> himſelf, and cannot meet with Alteration; they are imperfect things, that are ſubject to change, old things that paſs away, but God is infinitely perfect, and therefore cannot change or be moved from what he is, by any external or internal Cauſe; he cannot ceaſe to be what he was, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be what he was not: (as to his Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) indeed the <hi>Word,</hi> the ſecond Perſon, in time aſſumes the humane Nature, into a Union with himſelf, but then he doth not ceaſe to be what he was, that is perfect God, and ſo doth not change: and though he alters his Laws and Adminiſtrations of Worſhip, in the times of the Goſpel, yet he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not his mind, this Change was decreed from all Eternity: God determined them to be muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore they muſt change, or God would not be immutable. And whereas it may be urged, that God doth threaten to do what he doth not, and promiſe to perform, what he hath never fulfilled, and therefore is mutable. I anſwer, that God never threatens and promiſes in his word abſolutely, but conditionally, and the Condition failing, the Act on which it depends fails: but God doth not change his Mind, neither was this Mutability in man, accidental to God, but foreſeen and ſure, and ſo Gods Purpoſes thereabout, are not alterable, but eternal. And whereas God is ſaid, now to be angry, and then to Love, which argues a Mutation: yet that Change is not in Gods Will and Affection, which is one Eſſence with himſelf, but in his outward Diſpenſation. So that the Divine Nature in Chriſt is unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both in his Nature and Will, he cannot, he will not vary; in him is no Variableneſs, or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48427:16"/> Shadow of turning; he is a Rock, and his Work perfect; Time or Change in Creatures, work no Change in God; 'tis the Miſtake of Unbelief, to think that the Heart of God changes, as the poor Believer doth; like thoſe that row by the Shore, fancy the Land and Houſes on it to move, when 'tis but the Veſſel changes his place.</p>
               <p>Comfort thy Heart poor Soul (who haſt ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen the Lord to be thy Portion) on this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that the Thoughts of God are the ſame towards thee as ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>: all thy changeable Frames, and unfaithful Dealings with him, works no more Alteration in his Heart to thee, than the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Clouds, do on the eſſential Light of the Sun; or the Provocations of the Child, on the Fathers Relation, who is ſtill a Father, how unlike ſoever he carries himſelf to the Child: but theſe Inſtances are too ſhort to adumbrate and ſet out the Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of God, who cannot but be Truth, though every man be a Lye: he is faithful and cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf to his, though they believe not: 'Tis his Faithfulneſs ſecures thy Faith, and not thy Faith makes good his Faithfulneſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3. 4. <hi>Shall their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief make the Faith</hi> (or Faithfulneſs) <hi>of God, of none Effect? God forbid.</hi> Mat. 3. 6. <hi>I the Lord, change not, therefore ye Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is Chriſt immutable? Then there is Ground enough for Believers to caſt Anchor on him, and to bottom their ſtrong Hopes upon his Promiſes: <hi>for faithful is he that hath promiſed. Heb.</hi> 10. 23. <hi>He is not as man that he ſhould lye, or as the Son of man, that he ſhould repent.</hi> Numb. 23. 19. <hi>Hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good.</hi> He cannot
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48427:17"/> alter the Word that is gone out of his Mouth, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but not one Tittle of his Word, till all be fullfilled: <hi>For this end hath God ſhewed to the Heirs of Promiſe, the Immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Council (confirmed by an Oath) that by two immutable things</hi> (his Purpoſe and Promiſe) <hi>in which 'tis impoſſible for God to lye, they might have ſtrong Conſolation who have fled for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before them. Heb.</hi> 6. 18. 19. O Believer, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not thy Soul to be toſſed to and fro, with every change of Providence without, or of thy heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but roul thy Hopes on this Rock of Ages, on whom the Pillars of the Earth hang for their Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, the whole Creation for its Suſtentation, by whom Winter and Summer, Day and Night are kept within their Seaſons, and all the changes of his People, reduced into a Conſiſtency with his Covenant Fidelity.</p>
               <p>This alſo yields encouragement to Believers, for perſeverance in the way of Duty, whatever Alterations are in their Conditions and the Times they live in: becauſe he that leads them is the ſame, in the worſt, as well as the beſt of Times; and as able to ſecure them, and as firm in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to them, ſeeing he changes not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot, will not leave them.</p>
               <p>Again, To this Immutability of God in Chriſt, may gracious Souls go to get their unſteddy Hearts fixed, and derive by Faith more conſtancy to their Spirits towards God: He who is faithful hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged it, to eſtabliſh their Hearts with Grace, and keep them from Evil. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>But the Lord is faithful, who ſhall eſtabliſh you and keep you from evil.</hi> 2 Chro. 20. 20. <hi>Believe God, ſo ſhall you be eſtabliſhed.</hi> As Chriſt's Life is Security for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48427:17"/> Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. His Power for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. ſo is his Immutability for their Stedfaſtneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 12. The Author of this Pſalm, under the ſenſe of his weakneſs, and the languiſhing ſtate of <hi>Sion,</hi> comforts himſelf in the conſideration of Gods Immutability: <hi>But thou, O Lord, ſhalt endure for ever:</hi> And upon this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Spices raiſes his hopes of Sion (this he takes for granted, from his unalterableneſs) <hi>He ſhall appear in his Glory.</hi> Go, Believer, and lay (by Faith) thy changeable Heart on Chriſt's Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as the <hi>Shunamite</hi> did her dead Child on <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi>'s Bed, till ſhe received him to Life again, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 21. <hi>And ſhe ſaid</hi> (when her Child was dead) <hi>It ſhall be well,</hi> verſ. 23. So in the ſame Spirit of Faith with her, Leave thy Soul with a Faithful Jeſus to be made faithful alſo. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Faithful is he that calleth you, who will alſo do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Omniſcience of Chriſt is another of his Divine Attributes, by which he doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and in one Eternal and immutable Act, know himſelf, and all things that were, are, or ſhall be: and things that are not, that never were or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be; things natural and voluntary, neceſſary and contingent; things in their Cauſes and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, acted or intended, good or evil, finite or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; all are moſt clearly and fully naked and open in his ſight. He alone fully knows himſelf and his Divine Perfections, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>For what man knoweth the things of man, ſave the Spirit of a man, which is in man, even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>No man knoweth the Son, but the</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48427:18"/> 
                  <hi>Father, neither knoweth any man the Father, ſave the Son:</hi> That is, No man can know the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but God himſelf, immediately and perfectly; That knowledge which the Saints have of God, is but a ſecondary and communicated knowledge, of Gods back parts, as revealed in his Works, Word, and in a Mediatour, according to the meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt: But God knows himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and fully as he is: for his Knowledge is his Eſſence, and ſo as Infinite as his Being is. He is a pure Act without any potentiality: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Underſtanding and himſelf are the ſame. He knows alſo all things elſe that are in Being and not in Being; things paſt, preſent, or to come, in one eternal Act, without any ſearch into Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Cauſes; as Humane Underſtandings do, in a diſcourſive way, and by ſucceſſion: but hath the Idea's of all things in himſelf, his Eſſence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Exemplar of thoſe things, ſeeing he gives them their Being: As the Artificer knows the Forms of the Pieces he makes, and the Writer the proportion of his own Letters; ſo doth God, the firſt Cauſe, know all things that receive their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from him; they being firſt in him, and ſo eternally preſent to him. Hence the knowledge of God is moſt certain and infallible, and things are as he knows them, ſeeing his Knowledge gives them their Being: which muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the things that God approves of, as his Creatures, his Providences, and Evils of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are juſt and righteous: But ſinful Evils have no dependance on his Fore-knowledge, or Influence from his Eſſence. Indeed Actions, as they are natural, have their Being from God;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48427:18"/> but the pravity and ſinfulneſs of thoſe Acts (Sin being but the privation of that good which was, and ſhould be in them) is derived from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whoſe Acts they are: As the Motion of the Clock is from the Art of the Artificer; but the obliquity of the Motion is from ſome defect in the Clock it ſelf: Gods fore-knowledge of Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no Phyſical Vertue and neceſſity to the Being and ſucceſſion of Sin, and yet his knowledge of it is certain; all things being naked and manifeſt in his ſight, who is Truth it ſelf, and cannot deceive or be deceived: He determining to permit the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin, muſt needs fore-know it; elſe his Knowledge would not be perfect: and if his Knowledge ſhould be imperfect, his Eſſence would be ſo too, they being both the ſame; but this cannot conſiſt with the Fountain of all Perfection: He is the Holy One, and can do no Iniquity, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. His Fore-knowledge of Sin, doth not offer Violence to the Nature of man, or deſtroy the natural Freedom of his Will, but foreſeeing what man would be, determined to leave him to the natural Motion of his own Will. <hi>Judas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying Chriſt, as it was ſinful, was the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Gods Foreknowledge, but the effect of his own Covetouſneſs. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.</p>
               <p>All Contingencies are perfectly foreſeen of God alſo, both in himſelf as the firſt Cauſe, and ſo they are neceſſary to ſucceed in due time; he ſees them alſo in the ſecond Cauſes, in reſpect of which they are ſaid to be contingent, for to God nothing is accidental, although it ſeems ſo to men, through an Unacquaintedneſs with their Dependance on the firſt Cauſe: <hi>Rebeccah</hi>'s meeting <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48427:19"/> at the Well, and her Diſcourſe with him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 15. ſeem to Standers by, to be things contingent: but look back to the former Verſe, and you will ſee them to be the anſwer of Prayer, and ſo before appointed: The like was the <hi>Midianites</hi> drawing <hi>Joſeph</hi> out of the Pit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. and the Wind blowing down the Houſe on <hi>Job</hi>'s Children, <hi>Job</hi> 1. though they look like Accidents, yet were the Effects of Gods Permiſſion and fore-appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Again, God fore-knows all Contingencies, not only as they are in their firſt and ſecond Cauſes, but as they are in themſelves; for all things being preſent to him, he perfectly knows what every Cauſe will produce in time, and ſo muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily come to paſs; according to that Axiome; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is, when once it is, it appears neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that it ſhould be: <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 18. <hi>Known unto God are all his Works, from the beginning of the World.</hi> Heb. 4. 13. <hi>Neither is there any Creature which is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and open to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do.</hi> Pſal. 56. 8. <hi>Thou telleſt my wandrings, put thou my tears into thy Bottle, are not they in thy Book?</hi> Pſal. 139. 2. <hi>Thou underſtandeſt my Thoughts afar off:</hi> that is, before they are in Being. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 3. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> This Wiſdom of Chriſt, as God, is part of his Unſearchable Treaſure, and ſo great a Deep, that 'tis paſt finding out, by his moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Creatures in Heaven and Earth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>O the depths of the Riches, both of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his wayes paſt finding out.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48427:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p> Again, as God is infinitely wiſe in himſelf, ſo is he the Author of all Wiſdom to his Creatures; <hi>He enlightneth every one that cometh into the World. Jo.</hi> 1. 9. This is laid down to prove the Divine Nature of Chriſt, he is the <hi>Word,</hi> which is God; this appears both in his making all things <hi>verſe</hi> 3. and in his incomprehenſible Eſſence, <hi>He is the Light ſhining in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it not:</hi> Alſo, he is the Fountain of all that Light and Life his Creatures enjoy, and therefore muſt needs be God. The Evangeliſt doth not ſpeak here of Chriſt as Mediator, and ſo of that ſaving Light, which he gives to his Elect, by his Spirit; but of his divine Eſſence, which the <hi>Jews</hi> would not own, and as a proof of it; doth inſtance in his creatorly Power: he is the Fountain of that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light, which all men have: all Wiſdom comes from him, who is the Father of Lights; he is the Fountain of Light, able to fill the Children of men with all that Knowledge that is neceſſary, to their higheſt Happineſs, to guide them with his Eye, and lead them into all Truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This yields wonderful Comfort to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they have choſen ſuch a Saviour, as is able to make them wiſe to Salvation; who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows what is beſt for them, but can alſo reveal and make out the Knowledge thereof to them, that they might know and chuſe, what makes for their beſt Good here and for ever: <hi>He is the Son of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Mal. 4. 2. <hi>The bright Morning Star.</hi> Rev. 22. 16. <hi>The Light of</hi> Iſrael, Iſa. 10. 7. <hi>The Pillar of Fire by Night.</hi> Neh. 9. 12. To ſhew them their way, in their greateſt Difficulties and Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48427:20"/>
               <p> Secondly, This aſſures gracious Souls, that he who hath undertaken their Conduct, Supply, and Preſervation to Glory, knows how to make it good and finiſh the work he is intruſted with: he can keep that good thing committed to him; he can help them in the worſt of Straits, and lead them through the greateſt Improbabilities, Weakneſſes, Dangers, yea Impoſſibilities to their deſired Reſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This alſo relieves them, that they have a Friend in Heaven, who knows their Soul in Adverſity, and is acquainted with all their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Wants, Weakneſſes, Wrongs, Fears, Dangers, yea with all their Labours, Duties, Deſires and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for him, and knows how to ſuccour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſupport and deliver them, when all Refuge fails them, and there is none to help; and how to requite, and crown all their Duties and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for his Name: He knows their Corruptions, the Strength, and Prevalency of them, and how to ſubdue and deſtroy them; he ſees their Ways and Infirmities, and how to heal them, he knows the Power and Malice of their Enemies, to reſtrain them, and diſcovers the moſt ſecret Plots againſt his innocent ones, to diſappoint them, that in vain is the Snare laid in his Sight againſt them. He obſerves thy Tears Believer, thy corner Duties, thy Bed-ſide Breathings after him, though hid from others; he takes notice of thy Innocency, when men revile thee, and knows how to plead thy Cauſe, and bring thee to the Light.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This will ſerve to humble the proud Heart of men, that God is acquainted with all their Vileneſs; he ſees their high, their fretful,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48427:20"/> their vain, their unclean, their unſound, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Hearts. <hi>Souls;</hi> men ſee the beſt of you, your fair and ſpecious Duties, but he ſees your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and all your ſecret Rottenneſs, when you ſit before him, as his People ſit, and ſeem devout in your Services; he at the ſame time knows where your Thoughts are wandring, and eſpies every vain Motion and ſinful glance of your deceitful Eye: when thou prayeſt with greateſt Zeal, his Eye is upon thy cloſe Hypocriſie, thy ſpiritual Pride, thy baſe ends, and thoſe conceived Luſts, which will break out, when thy Duties are over. O how ſhould this abaſe thy proud Heart, and prevent thy ſwelling Thoughts upon conceited Excellencies in thy ſelf, or ſuppoſed Worth in thy Duties, ſeeing he knows what is in thee, and how vain man would be wiſe.</p>
               <p>This alſo ſhould adviſe thy Soul to Sincerity, in thy Profeſſion, Purpoſes, Promiſes, Duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beholds thee, and weighs thy Paths, ſearcheth thy Heart, tries thy Reins, and will ſhortly bring thy ſecret things to Judgment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly. This counſels ſuch as want Wiſdom, to be looking to Jeſus, and waiting at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and Spring-head, for their Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the Omnipotency of Chriſt, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe glorious Properties of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which renders him ſo vaſt, and unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Treaſure, to all that receive him, <hi>He is the mighty God the everlaſting Father. Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. who hath infinite Strength to order and eſtabliſh his Kingdom, and to exert his Government in <hi>Sion,</hi> and over Nations: his Strength muſt needs be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, becauſe his Kingdom is eternal; no created
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48427:21"/> humane arm, can ſway the Scepter of the World, and maintain an everlaſting Rule over the Hearts and Converſations of all his People, in all Ages; and therefore, he muſt be God, and the mighty God, to tranſact the whole Work, that concerns him, as Mediator, and to anſwer the Appellations given him in Scripture. Things are aſcribed to Chriſt, which cannot be performed by leſs than an infinite Power.</p>
               <p>Firſt, His creating all things in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>By him were all things created, that are in Heaven and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him:</hi> He is the eternal Word, the Exemplar, and efficient Cauſe of all created Beings; The Heavens and Earth, Angels and men, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the upper and nether World, were all form'd by <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Chriſt, who gave Being to all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as pleaſed him; and therefore his Power muſt needs be Almighty, <hi>who is the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the Earth, that fainteth not, be that giveth Breath unto the People up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and Spirit to them that walk therein.</hi> Iſa. 40. 28. chap. 42. 5.</p>
               <p>What a potent Lord have Believers choſen, who can ſuperſede all their Difficulties, by his Creation-help? if his whole Store-houſe of Heaven and Earth be not full enough to ſupply their Wants, he can ſoon ſet forth a new Edition of Mercies by his own immediate arm; if their way to Glory, lye through a waſte howling Wilderneſs where no Foot-ſteps can be ſeen to guide them, he can create a Cloud by day, and Pillar of Fire by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48427:21"/> Night to conduct them: If their Proviſions fail to relieve them in their Journey, he can rain a Shower of <hi>Manna</hi> from his ſecret Granary, and open the Caverns of the Flinty Rock, and put new Springs into the barren Wilderneſs to refreſh them; when they are invironed with Troops of Death, he can, in a Moment, interpoſe his fiery Chariots and Horſe-men, and when all their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers fail, ſend from Heaven, and ſave them: when the Viſibility of Religion ceaſes, and the Heavens paſs away as a Scrole, when the Glory of the Lords Houſe is diſſolv'd into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> when the Gold of the Sanctuary is become Droſs, and the Goſpel-Church metamorphoz'd into the old World, he can even then create a new Heaven, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs. Is thy Heart, Believer, full of filthineſs? Thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer can create a clean Heart: and if thy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt-toſſed Soul can find no reſt, thy Lord can cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Fruit of the Lips, Peace for thee: What is too hard for a creating Arm to do? Or what can undoe that People, who have a faithful Creator to commit themſelves, and all their Concerns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Proof of the Omnipotency of Chriſt, is the upholding all things by the Word of his Power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Who being the Brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, and upholding all things by the Word of his Power.</hi> Here's another Royalty of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, a new beaming out of his Glory as God, even in the bearing up, maintaining, and Diſpoſe of the whole Creation, in the former <hi>ver.</hi> the forming of the Univerſe, and whole World,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48427:22"/> was aſcribed to Chriſt: and here the Preſervation of it alſo, is laid upon him, as a further Evidence of his oneneſs with the Father: having begun his Work in the Creation, he carries it on in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Suſtentation thereof, <hi>He is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt. Col.</hi> 1. 17. He is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that underprops the whole Fabrick of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, which would ſoon ſink down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its firſt nothing, if everlaſting Arms were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from beneath it, he that firſt gives Being to his Creatures, muſt continue it; Conſervation is but a Continuation of the firſt act of Creation, to preſerve the World from Deſtruction, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Creatures in their peculiar Nature and Properties, and to govern thoſe Diverſities in an united Subſerviency to his Will and Glory; and the Well-being of the whole, is a work of infinite Power, and needs the ſame Strength, that firſt produced them. And this is the work (Chriſtians) of your <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that perſon who is God-Man; who by his divine power and efficacious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, animates, actuates, cheriſhes, quickens, and ſweetly diſpoſes of all Creatures, Actions and Affairs in the World. He is the great Monarch of Heaven and Earth, that changes Times and Seaſons, whoſe hands are under his Wings, and hath a wheel within the Wheels, that turns about things as pleaſeth him; brings Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Order out of Confuſion, Good out of Evil: who hath the Government on his Shoulders, and abſolute Power in his hand, to diſpoſe of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things, as may moſt further the Pleaſure of his own Will, the Advance of his Glory, and the Good of them that fear him.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48427:22"/>
               <p> And is not this Security enough to thoſe, who have intruſted themſelves and all their Concerns, with this glorious Potentate, and King of Kings, who hath the Management of all things in Heaven and Earth, that it ſhall be well at laſt with the righteous? the momentous Affairs of the world, and of <hi>Sion,</hi> ſhall iſſue in the beſt Good of thoſe that love his Name. How ſhould this calm the tumultuous Fears of the godly into a ſweet Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit, and ſtill their tempeſtuous Thoughts in a quiet Relyance on the Arm, Care, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their Lord, who knows how to govern the World, and can, and will bring about his Work to gracious ends by all ſeeming Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and interfering Providences in the World. <hi>Why art thou afraid, ſaith</hi> Caeſar, <hi>to the Maſter of the Ship, that began to be diſturb'd in his Spirits, by reaſon of the Storm and the Darkneſs of the Night? Thou carryeſt</hi> Caeſar. How much more ſhould Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers be ſedate and quiet in their Minds, who have embarqued Chriſt. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had only ſome Command at Land, none over the Sea; he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the Bodies of a few men, but Chriſt rules at Land and Sea; he ſits upon the Floods, and at the Helm of this great Veſſel of the World; how ſhould this lift the Saints Heads above all their Waters?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt's working Miracles by his own Power, proves his Omnipotency, that nothing is too hard for him; a Miracle is ſomewhat done, which is above and beſides the Power and Courſe of Nature; not only as the thing done, but as the manner of doing, when the Cauſe is ſecret, and unknown to us, and the thing utterly beyond all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48427:23"/> Cauſes, that's a Miracle which none but God can do, either mediately by ſecondary Agents, or immediately of himſelf. Miracles are only done by a divine hand, becauſe none but God can change the Order of Nature: and this Chriſt did, not by anothers, but by his own power: <hi>The Humane Nature in Chriſt was but the Inſtrument of the divine Action, and the humane Action received it's Vertue from the divine Nature,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas.</hi> It was by his own Power, that Chriſt did ſuch mighty works as no man ever did. 'Tis ſaid, Vertue went out of him, and healed all their Diſeaſes who touched him. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 19. It was by his word he caſt out Devils, and healed them that were ſick. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 6. The Wind, and the Seas obey'd him. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. With Authority he commanded the unclean Spirits and they obey'd him. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 27. He opened the Eyes of them that were born blind, made the dumb to ſpeak, the dead to walk; by which migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Works, he proves himſelf to be one with the Father: <hi>What he ſeeth the Father do, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe; for as the Father raiſeth up the dead and quickneth them, even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will.</hi> Jo. 6. 19. 24.</p>
               <p>Neither did he ſhew ſuch Wonders himſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by his Power he enables his Servants alſo, to do ſuch mighty Works, as were above the Power of lapſed Nature to do. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 17. 18. <hi>And theſe Signs ſhall follow them that believe in my Name (i. e.</hi> by my Power and Authority from me) <hi>ſhall they caſt out Devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new Tongues, they ſhall take up Serpents, and if they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ink any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt them, they ſhall lay hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recover.</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48427:23"/> And ſurely, if the exerted Power of Chriſt by weak Inſtruments, could do ſuch mighty things, above the Capacity of natural Agents, then the eſſential Power of Chriſt can do much more than what he hath done.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That muſt needs be an Almighty Power in Chriſt, that can beſtow on the Saints, all things that they ſhall ask of the Father in his name: but ſuch is the Power of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask of the Father in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> He doth not ſay, my Father ſhall do it, or that will I procure for you by my Mediation and Intereſt in the Father; though that be true alſo: but that will I do by my own Power, as God equal with the Father. (I will do it) this he repeats again in the next <hi>ver. If ye ſhall ask any thing in my Name, I will do it,</hi> being willing to fix this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truth in their Minds, that as he was reſolv'd to fullfill all their juſt Deſires, made in his name, ſo he was able to do it, the Father and he being one. And this muſt needs be an Almighty power, to hear and anſwer all the Requeſts of all the Saints on Earth, at once: what multitudes are there of Believers in every Age, more than can be numbred, who are alway compaſſing the Throne, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a Cloud of Incenſe, to the Mercy Seat dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; putting up Variety of Requeſts to the Father, through Chriſt, and that not for mean things nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? They beg for the holy Spirit, for the Shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings abroad of his Love, and Shinings out of his Glory; for treading down of <hi>Satan,</hi> for ſubduing of Corruption, for Conqueſt over his Enemies, Enlargement of his Kingdom; for an Almightineſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48427:24"/> to do, and invincible Patience to ſuffer the whole Will of God, for the Forgiveneſs of great Sins, and Multitudes of Sins, for Perſeverance in Grace, and for an eternal Crown of Glory; theſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things and great things, things that none but a God can give, and yet no more than what Chriſt is engag'd to beſtow on all that ſincerely ſeek him; and therefore muſt needs be God Almighty, and worthy of Sinners Choice, and of the Saints Truſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This alſo ſets forth the Omnipotency of Chriſt, that he is able not only to do all things for, but in his People, working all their Works in them; the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves, to think a Thought that is good; Neither know we what to pray for as we ought. Rom.</hi> 8. 26. In them dwells no good thing, as they are in themſelves; Neither can they do any thing without him: their Eyes are unto him for all their Help, their Springs are in him: in the Lord ſhall one ſay have I Righteouſneſs and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rength; they are dead as to any ſelf-ſufficiency for the leaſt thing that is good; but he is their Life, the Soul that animates all their Faculties, the hand that leads them, the Wiſdom that directs them, the Power that actuates them in every good thing. Their Works muſt be wrought in God or can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be good; 'tis he that works in them, to will, and to do, of his good Pleaſure, he teacheth them to profit, he held <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the hand teaching him to go: he carries his Lambs in his Arms, and gently drives them that are with young; drawing thoſe that are indiſpoſed, quickening them that are dead: he is the Fountain that fills all their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48427:24"/> Pits, the Head that gives out animal Influences to every Member, for every Duty: and muſt not he then be an all-ſufficient God, and have an infinite Treaſury to give to all richly to enjoy, and an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Arm to do all the work of Saints on Earth? O admire Believers, and relye on this Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, raiſing the dead is an act of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, a peculiar Property of the divine Nature, which hath been, is, and ſhall be the Work of Chriſt; <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life.</hi> Jo. 11. 25. <hi>i. e.</hi> He for whoſe ſake and by whoſe Power the dead ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day. <hi>Martha</hi> ſuſpects Chriſts Ability to revive her dead Brother, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved indeed, he ſhould riſe at the laſt day, and not before; why ſaith Chriſt, they that ſhall then riſe from the dead, ſhall riſe by my Power; and if I will raiſe up the dead then, I can as eaſily do it now. <hi>The hour is comming in which all that are in their Graves, ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done Good, unto the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Life, and they that have done evil, unto the Reſurrection of Damnation. Joh.</hi> 5. 28. 29. <hi>And I will raiſe him up at the laſt day. Joh.</hi> 6. 54. That there ſhall be a general Reſurrection of the dead, at the laſt day; when every Body (though now conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) ſhall be raiſed up and reunited to the Soul, and be brought to the final Judgment, is not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned by thoſe that believe, and know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The Author of this Reſurrection is God, as God, but the ſecond Perſon, the Lord Jeſus, is delegated to accompliſh this Work, which he ſhall do by his own Voice, (ſaith Chriſt himſelf) by a Shout, by the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48427:25"/> with a great Sound of a Trumpet, ſaith the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. That is, the Lord Jeſus ſhall, at that laſt day, by his mighty Voice, pronounced by the Arch-Angel, cauſe all the dead, both ſmall and great, to ariſe in their ſame Bodies, though chang'd into an immortal State, and ſuitable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, to that Condition, to which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to receive their Soul, and to come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And is not this a mighty Work, to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the dead, a work peculiarly aſcribed to God. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>For we had the Sentence of Death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the Dead:</hi> 'Tis the work of God, and of none but God, to raiſe the dead: 'Tis a work full of Wonder and Amazement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Principles of created reaſon, to conceive how thoſe Bodies diſſolved to duſt, mingled with other Bodies in the Grave, digeſted into other Natures, by Beaſts, Fiſhes, Fowls, that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them, ſhould yet return and be ſeparated from other Duſt and Natures, into the ſame Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, is ſuch a Miracle as is only fit matter for Faith, not Senſe, and a firm Foundation for the Believers Hope and Comfort.</p>
               <p>It may be thou ſeeſt nothing but Deaths on thy Graces, Frames and Capacities; thou findeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes in thy Soul, the Spirit of Life ſeems to be departed from thee, thou canſt not pray, hear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, with that ſweetneſs and delight as heretofore; Comfort thy ſelf Believer; He that is the <hi>Life,</hi> is the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> alſo: He that quickned thy Heart, when Dead, will revive it, when decay'd: 'Tis as eaſie with him to reſtore thy Spiritual Frames, as to beſtow them: He that can raiſe the whole
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48427:25"/> World from their Bodily, total Death; can eaſily, and will, in due time, cure thy Soul-dyings alſo.</p>
               <p>Again, This will chear drooping Sion, who faints at her Deſolations, and fears what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the deſtruction on her Intereſts: 'Tis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to obſerving Souls, to ſee how Religion goes down daily: Holineſs is departed from the Earth: The Rod of the wicked lies on the back of the Righteous: the wicked are exalted, and the Righteous oppreſſed: The Houſe of <hi>David</hi> waxes weaker and weaker, and the Houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> waxes ſtronger: This is a ſad Spectacle; yet in this caſe Relief is to be fetch'd from an Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Jeſus: who hath ſaid, His dead men ſhall live: who can open his Peoples graves, and revive his decay'd Intereſt, and cauſe a Nation to bring forth in a day: and Overturn, Overturn, Overturn, till his Kingdom be eſtabliſhed in the Earth.</p>

                  <p>The Humane Nature of Chriſt, diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd; it's Reality proved: His Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or the Divine and Humane Nature in one Perſon; ſhewing what kind of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion it is, and the glorious Conſequents and Advantages thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have a little enquired into the Divine Nature of Chriſt: the Beams of whoſe Glory, but darkly ſeen, yield a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48427:26"/> ſplendor, and reviving to a believing Eye. In the next place, let us conſider his Humanity: The Nature of Man, which the ſecond Perſon, aſſumes into a Perſonal Union with himſelf: He is perfect Man as well as God: The Woman's Seed; <hi>Made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. <hi>Made of the Seed of</hi> David <hi>according to the Fleſh.</hi> Rom. 1. 3. <hi>For he took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of</hi> Abraham. Heb. 2. 16. <hi>The Children being partakers of fleſh and blood, he likewiſe took part of the ſame,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>And was in all things made like to his Brethren,</hi> ver. 17. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son of Man: the Man Chriſt Jeſus: having the Subſtante of the Humane Nature; though not the Perſonal Subſiſtence thereof: He did not take the Perſon of Man into Union with himſelf: for then he would have had two Perſons: and ſo have been no true Mediator: The Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> But if the Lord Jeſus had taken the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Man, then he would have conſiſted of two Perſons: the Divine Subſiſtence and the Humane; and ſo there would have been two Mediators, or Perſons mediating, which is contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Neither did he take on him the vicious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Accidents of the Humane Nature: being holy, harmleſs, ſeparate from Sinners: the Holy Spirit overſhadowing the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and purging the Humane Nature of all its ſinful dregs: forming it of the Subſtance of the Virgin: not of his own Eſſence: whence the Holy thing begotten by the Spirit was not God, but Man; called <hi>the Holy</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48427:26"/> 
                  <hi>Child Jeſus:</hi> purely conceived in the Womb of a Sinner, without the leaſt participation of her Sin, or vicious Defects of her Nature, receiving only the perfect Subſtance of Man.</p>

               <p>A true and real Body, and not a Phantaſme, and Airy Vehicle, as the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and Hereticks of old held: He had Fleſh and Bones, which a Spirit hath not, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 39. <hi>Handle me and ſee me, for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me have:</hi> This was after his Reſurrection, when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples doubted that it was an Apparition and not him, and even then Chriſt had a real Body, palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and viſible, the object of External Senſes.</p>
               <p>A Natural, and not an Heavenly Body, as the <hi>Manichees</hi> affirm'd from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. <hi>The firſt man is of the Earth, Earthy; the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven.</hi> But to this I anſwer with <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak here of the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Body of Chriſt; but of his Heavenly Spiritual Power, which he lets out in raiſing the Dead; as in the former <hi>verſe. The firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living Soul, the laſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickning Spirit:</hi> He ſpeaks not here of the Nature, but of the perſon of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as Mediator; the Difference between whom was great: the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> but a Creature, this a Creator or Quickning Spirit: the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had his Riſe from the Earth, this ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as to his perſon, from Heaven: whence (ſaith <hi>Paraeus)</hi> 'tis evident, the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak here of the matter of Chriſts Body, but of the Original and Dignity of his Perſon: for he grants in this whole Diſcourſe, that Chriſt's
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48427:27"/> Body is one and the ſame with ours; elſe how can his Reſurrection be a proof of ours: and 'tis ſaid, <hi>As by man came death, ſo by man came alſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead:</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20, 21, 22. And if Chriſt had not a real, natural Body, then he could not be the Seed of the Woman; neither had his Death been a real Death, or a ſatisfactory Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation; if the ſame Nature that ſinned had not alſo ſuffered: And therefore it muſt needs be that Chriſt had a Natural Body: He Eat, Drank, Spake, Walked, was weary, ſmitten, bound, crucified: which are alſo demonſtrations of a Natural Body.</p>
               <p>And as he had a perfect Body, ſo had he a Soul alſo; contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Apollinaris;</hi> or elſe he could not be a perfect Man, and in all things made like unto his Brethren: for 'tis ſaid, when God made Man, <hi>He breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and man became a living Soul,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. Hence, ſaith <hi>Lactantius, A Soul-leſs Body is no Humane Body:</hi> 'Tis ſaid, <hi>His Soul was exceeding ſorrowful, even unto Death,</hi> Mat. 26. 38. Had not Chriſt a real Soul, he had not been a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man, nor could be ſaid to have died, when he cried out, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commit my Spirit,</hi> Luke 23. 46. <hi>And having ſaid ſo, he gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> This Spirit the Lord Jeſus gave up into his Father's hands, was not his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that was one with, and ever with the Father: and therefore muſt needs be his Soul; which was his Life; and that departing, he is ſaid to dye, and give up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides, That Knowledge in which he is ſaid to increaſe, with thoſe Humane Affections that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeared in him, and thoſe Acts of his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48427:27"/> Natural Will, plainly proves his Soul: theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eſſential Faculties of a Rational Spirit. Neither could he have perfectly tranſacted the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Mediator, and undergone all the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that were to be borne for the Sin of Man, had he not conſiſted of a Humane Soul, as well as Body; part of theſe Penalties, yea the greateſt part being Spiritual, and ſuch as none but the Soul could be fully ſenſible of: And in point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the Soul of man having ſinned, there muſt be a Soul alſo in the Redeemer to undergo Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; wherefore he muſt needs be perfect man in the Eſſential Parts of the Humane Nature,</p>

               </list>
               <p>He had alſo the Properties of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both Eſſential and Accidental: The Eſſential Properties of man, as well of the Soul, as Body, were in him: The Eſſential Properties, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, which are the Underſtanding, Will, Affections, were ſeated in his Nature; he had a created Underſtanding, that eminently ſhin'd out in his youthful years, being able, at Twelve years old, to diſpute with the Learned Doctors, of his Day, even to the aſtoniſhment of his Hearers. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 46, 47. <hi>And they found him in the Temple, ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them Queſtions; and all that heard him were aſtoniſhed at his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Anſwers.</hi> And ver. 52. <hi>Jeſus increaſed in Wiſdom and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had likewiſe Natural Affections, ſo as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin: He loved the young man in the Goſpel, for thoſe Excellencies that were in him, <hi>Mark</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48427:28"/> 10. 21. And had a peculiar degree of Affection to <hi>John</hi> above the reſt of the Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 26. He had compaſſion on the multitude, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 36. And was grieved for the Heart hardneſs of his Diſciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 5. And had indignation againſt <hi>Peter</hi>'s tempting him to decline his Redemption-work. <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 33.</p>
               <p>He had alſo the Eſſential Properties of a Humane Body, ſuch as do flow from the Eſſence thereof, and are ſo abſolutely neceſſary to it, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe the Body would ceaſe to be a Body: as Quantity, Figure, Members, Dimenſions: He had a Material Body, conſiſting of Fleſh and Bone, with its Lineaments and Members; Face, Hands, Feet; he had a Stature, in which he grew, as other men do, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 52. A Body circumſcribed in a place, that muſt needs have a Circumference, and be in one place at once circumſcriptively, not definitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Spirits are: Neither does its Union with the Divine Nature, or its glorified ſtate in Heaven, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Eſſential Property of a Body: Nor is the Omnipotency of God a ſufficient Argument to warrant the Body of Chriſt to be in Heaven, and Earth, and in divers places at once; ſeeing God's Abſolute Power never croſſeth his Actual Power, or infer a contrariety to his Truth, and to the natural Being of things. Neither did he aſſume the Parts and Eſſential Properties of Man only, but the Infirmities alſo, and accidental Properties of the Humane Nature: though not thoſe which were Perſonal and Vicious, and procur'd by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Sins, or defection in their particular Natures, as Diſeaſes, Blindneſs, Lameneſs, Deformity, which were not the abſolute and univerſal Products of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48427:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> Original Sin, incident to every one, but ariſing from ſome particular Cauſes, and peculiar to ſome Perſons onely; theſe our Lord Jeſus did not take upon him, but ſuch Infirmities as were acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the whole Nature, <hi>for that he himſelf alſo is compaſſed with Infirmities, Heb.</hi> 5. 2. not ſinful; as culpable Ignorance and Errour, but Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, ſuch as were incident to our Natures, (Sin excepted) and ſuch as were the Effects and Puniſhment of Sin: theſe Chriſt took on him, as inculpable Ignorance, Humane Paſſions of Sorrow, Fear, Anger in the Soul, Hunger, Thirſt, Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pain, bloody Sweat, and Death in the Body. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 38. <hi>Math.</hi> 9. 36. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 50.</p>
               <p>And O what enriching Priviledges, and full Conſolation, do flow to Believers, from the <hi>Words</hi> aſſuming the Humane Nature into Perſonality with himſelf! And what glorious Excellencies are in Jeſus Chriſt, as he is God-Man, in one Perſon! infinite Treaſures, which can never be traced out, nor fully underſtood by the Children of men, as will appear, if we conſider the kind of this Union, and the Conſequents of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider the kind of this Union, between the Divine and Humane Nature of Chriſt; and O what a glorious Myſtery is it!</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a <hi>real</hi> Union: 'tis not Nominal, in Name onely, or Metaphorical, in Shew or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; but in Reality and Truth. The Divine and Humane Nature do conſtitute one Perſon, which is Jeſus Chriſt. We have already proved that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is perfect God, and perfect Man: he is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48427:29"/> really ſo in one perſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and we beheld his Glory.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> that is, the divine Nature, the God-head of Chriſt, <hi>was made Fleſh;</hi> that is, united to the humane Nature, and this in a viſible way: <hi>and dwelt amongſt us,</hi> it was not a Fiction, but really Chriſt, God-man, dwelt amongſt us, <hi>and we beheld his Glory,</hi> it was obvious to our view, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God was manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels.</hi> If this be not real, what can be ſo? <hi>He was manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> How? By way of real Union, <hi>Juſtified in the Spirit,</hi> by the divine Nature; here's Fleſh, and here's the divine Nature, in one perſon, Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man, ſeen of Angels, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. 4. <hi>Concerning his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, which was made of the ſeed of</hi> David <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, and declared to be the Son of God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holineſs, by the Reſurrection from the Dead:</hi> Here's a Perſon conſiſting of both theſe Natures, real man, born of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> then real God; thus the Divine Nature was manifeſted to be in Chriſt, by the Reſurrection of the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>And of whom as concerning the Fleſh Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Here both Natures are attributed to one Perſon; Jeſus Chriſt, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fleſh, deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> he came from <hi>David,</hi> that is, he received the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and he is God over all, bleſſed for ever. The God-head is ſaid to dwell in him bodily, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a very <hi>near</hi> Union, the neareſt Union that poſſibly can be. As the Soul and the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48427:29"/> Body make up one man, ſo the divine and humane Nature of Chriſt, make up one Perſon. It is ſet forth by way of Inhabitation, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>In him dwells all the Fullneſs of the God-head bodily.</hi> God manifeſt in the Fleſh, and juſtified in the Spirit makes up one entire Perſon. As the Matter and the Form makes up one Being, ſo this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane Nature makes up one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a <hi>myſtical</hi> and <hi>unconceivable</hi> Union. There's a relative Union between Man and Wife, making one Fleſh; a real Union between the Head and Members, conſtituting one Body; but this cannot reach this Union; it is unconceivable, above all Conception, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi> We may admire it, and adore it, but we cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom the depth of this Union between the divine and humane Nature of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unmixed</hi> Union as to each Nature. In regard of Eſſence the divine Nature cannot be converted into the humane, nor the humane into the divine, but each Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains diſtinct, and it's Properties are diſtinct, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. 4. So that there are in Jeſus Chriſt, two Natures, two Wills, a divine Will, and a humane Will: he hath the Will and Affections of a man, though fully ſanctified and glorified: he wills whatever the God-head wills, but ſtill, as to his humane Nature, it is with a humane Will; ſo that ſomething of the workings of Chriſt, are by the divine Power, and ſomething by the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This Union conſiſts in the Communication of the divine Nature with the humane, the God-head,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48427:30"/> and the humane Nature agree; ſo that the divine Nature of Chriſt communicates all its full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as far as may further Redemption-ends; for the Sanctification and Salvation of the whole body of Chriſt, and for the fulfilling of all Redemption-Work, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. This is a glorious Union, but it is worthy to be known. Ah how little of Chriſt is known as to theſe two Natures! how little a portion do we know of him!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is an <hi>inſeparable</hi> Union, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be parted more. Therein lies the Happineſs of Believers, that Jeſus Chriſt is God-man, to all Eternity, never can there be an end of this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt God-Man, is the ſame Yeſterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. He was the ſame while in his obediential Work, on Earth; he is the ſame in Glory, and will be the ſame to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. This Union of Chriſt's two Natures muſt be eternal, or elſe he cannot be ſaid ever to live to make Interceſſion; <hi>But he ever lives to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. That which made Chriſt's Redemption infinite, was that he was God as well as Man: Chriſt the Interceder, God-Man, is now in Heaven, and this muſt be for ever. O what a glorious Truth is this, that there can be no Ceſſation of this Union! could this Union be ſeparated as <hi>Neſtorius</hi> holds, then Redemption-work would ceaſe: <hi>He is over all, God-Man, bleſſed for evermore, Rom.</hi> 9. 5. If the Saints Union with Chriſt be inſeparable, and their Intereſt in the Love of Chriſt inſeparable, then Chriſt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable; but becauſe the Saints muſt have an eternal Union with him, and he is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jeſus, he muſt be eternally God-Man,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48427:30"/> 
                  <hi>Romans</hi> 8. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21. 23. 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What are the Effects and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, that flow from, and iſſue out of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the divine and humane Nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Firſt, from this Union of theſe two Natures in Chriſt, there follows a Communication of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; ſo that which is ſaid to be done by each Nature, is applied to the whole Perſon of Chriſt; O this is a very glorious Myſtery. as this, Chriſt's Sufferings in the humane Nature, is applyed to the whole Perſon of Chriſt; therefore the Blood of Chriſt, which was but the Blood of the humane Nature, is called the Blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood;</hi> being of infinite Value and Worth. So the Sufferings of the humane Nature are aſcribed ſometimes to the divine Nature, and to the whole perſon of Chriſt; ſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. God manifeſt in the Fleſh, and juſtified in the Spirit; yet both theſe applyed to the perſon of Chriſt: whatever the divine nature can do is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Perſon of Chriſt, by a Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Properties, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>owing from this Union.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From this Union, flows this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, That there is Fullneſs of Grace plac'd in Jeſus Chriſt to be given out to all his Seed. The God-head fills the humane Nature of Chriſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 34, <hi>God hath not given the Spirit by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to him.</hi> When we read of Chriſt's receiving any thing, underſtand it of his humane Nature; for the divine Nature cannot be capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing; it is as full of Grace as ever it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48427:31"/> can hold: And, as the Breaſt is full of Milk for the Poor Babe, ſo is Jeſus Chriſt full of Grace in his Humane Nature, to diſtribute to his Children: His pity moves him to give out this, and the other Grace to his People, and it is in him to beſtow it. He wills the beſt good to all his People, and what he wills, he is able to perform; hence 'tis ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Of his Fulneſs we have all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi> Of that Fulneſs which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is alwayes iſſuing out to the Humane Nature of Chriſt, do Believers receive Grace for Grace; Grace ſutable to Grace in Chriſt; ſo that the Humane Nature of Chriſt muſt needs be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes full of Grace, by reaſon of its Union with the Divine: As the Sun that gives out Light is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes full of Light, and the Sea that ſends forth Waters to the Rivers, is never vacant. This is a glorious Myſtery, of wonderful Encouragement to Believers, to conſider what a full Jeſus they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By vertue of this Union, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath right to all Glory, and Adoration of Men and Angels, as Mediatour. He is the moſt Illuſtrious Perſon; all Honour, Bleſſing, Praiſe, Glory, Adoration is due to him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>When he bringeth in the firſt-begotten into the world, he ſaith, And let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> Surely he muſt be a glorious Perſon, when all the Angels muſt bow at his Feet; Seraphims, Cherubims, and all the Hoſt of Heaven, ſtoop and give Homage to him, this the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a proper Right to, as he is God-Man: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every name;</hi> Every Tongue ſhall confeſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48427:31"/> at laſt, that he is Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>And when I ſaw him, I fell at his Feet as dead.</hi> O the very Viſion of Chriſt is enough to ſtrike a poor Creature to the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11. The four and twenty Elders fell down and worſhipped this glorious Perſon that ſate upon the Throne, which is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father:</hi> So that God the Son, the Second Perſon, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of his People, deſerves all that Divine and Religious Worſhip which is due to God, as God: Thrones and Principalities are made by him, and put under him. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. 17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By vertue of this Union, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath abſolute Authority, Kingſhip, and Headſhip in his Church, and over all things to the Church, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>All Power is given to me in Heaven and Earth.</hi> O what vaſt Power is this! All Power on Earth, to do what he will there; All Power in Heaven, to do what he will there, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>And hath put all things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, as God-Man, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with all Power and Authority, to tranſact the Work of a Mediator, to perform the Offices of Prophet, Prieſt, and King: The Godhead of Chriſt, working, as God, and the Manhood of Chriſt, working, as Man, yet both theſe Natures concurr towards the management of Redemption-work.</p>
               <p>As a Prophet, he is able to reveal the Will of God, for he knoweth the mind of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, he is infinite in Wiſdom, <hi>Job.</hi> 36. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. All Knowledge comes from him, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48427:32"/> Mediator: In him are hid the Treaſures of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. He maketh Wiſe to Salvation; He giveth Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 6. He openeth the Eyes of the blind, and giveth Light to them that ſit in Darkneſs, and in the Region and ſhadow of Death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 32. Miniſters can but preach to the Ear, but Chriſt can preach to the Heart: Miniſters can but open the Scriptures, Chriſt can open the Heart: He is a full and effectual Head to his Body, the Church, to guide, influence and adorn it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>As a Prieſt: And ſo there's an infinite Sufficiency in his Satisfaction and Interceſſion, ſeeing he is God-Man; In his Satisfaction enough to ſilence all Pleas againſt his People; He can arreſt all the Sentences and Executions of the Law againſt them. As an High-prieſt; he is a ſufficient Sacrifice for the Sins of the People: <hi>He was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. By the Obedience of Chriſt all Believers are made Righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. The Obedience of the Saints is repreſented compleat in Chriſt, though imperfect in themſelves. Hence Believers that are wounded with the ſhortneſs of their Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in themſelves, may lift up their Heads, when they look upon the perfect Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Hence, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>If any man Sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Righteous: And he is the propitiation for our Sins.</hi> Though the Saints do ſin, Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Sacrifice for them. This one Offering of Chriſt ever appears before God; when new Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations appear in his People: <hi>By one Offering he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48427:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> By vertue of this Union, his Blood becomes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Blood, equally as large as the Offence: Nay, it is more able to ſave, than the Sins of Believers to damn: <hi>It is the Blood of Chriſt that cleanſeth from all Sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. Therefore his Obedience is a perfect Obedience, and his Sufferings perfect Sufferings: of more ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, than if all the Sinners in the World had lain in Hell to all Eternity. This Blood is ſo wonderfully precious, that it is accounted by the Father as the Blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. If Infinite can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Infinite, then the Father is ſatisfied by the Blood of Chriſt; becauſe whatever the Juſtice of God can expect, the Obedience of Chriſt can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfie. This Righteouſneſs to Juſtification, the perfect Obedience and Sufferings of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no Addition or Diminution by the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Diſobedience of his People, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi> Ah! little do Souls know the Bottom they ſtand upon: It is not (poor Believer) the ſhortneſs of thy Obedience, the multitude and greatneſs of thy Sins, can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match this matchleſs Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.

               <p>Again, By vertue of this Union, There's Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>He muſt needs be able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him, ſeeing he ever lives to make Interceſſion,</hi> Heb. 7. 24, 25. <hi>How much more ſhall the Blood of</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48427:33"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſt, who, through the Eternal Spirit, offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot to God, purge your Conſciences from dead works,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. The Blood of Chriſt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly purges the Soul from all filthineſs, being offered through the Eternal Spirit. God will not deny himſelf: whatever God the Son intercedes for, God the Father will grant; ſo that Chriſt's Interceſſion muſt needs be effectual. O what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency hath Chriſt in Heaven! what Prevalency in all his Addreſſes to the Father! <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for his Church; that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it; and that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, without ſpot or wrinkle.</hi> Here's a double Effect of Chriſt's Mediatorſhip: One is, By vertue of this Blood, the Spirit comes, and cleanſes away the Corruption, and ſubdues the Iniquities of his People: this is that cleanſing by Sanctification: Then there's a preſenting the Saints to the Father, complete in him, without ſpot or wrinkle: thus the vertue of Chriſt's Interceſſion, and Righteouſneſs applied by him to the Believer. doth prove ſuch a covering for all Believers, that it hides every ſpot from God's Judicial Eye, that the Lord is ſaid to behold no Iniquity in them, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo as to be angry with them; they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented lovely, and comely in Chriſt, though black and deformed in themſelves.</p>
               <p>As a King: And ſo he hath Authority to erect a Kingdom of Grace in the World, to make Laws for the well-being of his Church, and to require Obedience of all Perſons. Hence the Magiſtrates of the World are call'd upon to ſtoop to Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry.</hi> All Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the World is placed under Jeſus Chriſt, in order to the carrying on his Mediatorly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48427:33"/> Hence 'tis ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Juſtice:</hi> they have their Power and Authority, by the Government, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Jeſus Chriſt, who is ſaid to be <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Rev.</hi> 19. 16. He hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power over every Creature; Every Knee muſt bow, and every Tongue confeſs to him; all muſt ſubject to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>For the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the Lords, and he is the Governour among the Nations: He ſhall have Dominion alſo from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the ends of the Earth: They that dwell in the Wilderneſs ſhall bow before him, and his Enemies ſhall lick the duſt,</hi> Pſal. 72. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>As a King, he is inveſted with Right and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to give out the Spirit of Grace for the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fulfilling of, and compleating Obedience to all his Laws, by his Church and People. Obedience to the Laws of Chriſt cannot be yielded but by the Spirit; the beſt of his People are no further ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, than they are Spiritual; for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is Enmity againſt God: Hence he ſaith, <hi>When I go away, I will ſend the Comforter, John</hi> 16. 7. It is an Expreſſion that notes Authority: When I go away, when I mount my Throne, I will ſend the Spirit; and he ſhall promote Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: <hi>He ſhall lead his People into all Truth,</hi> ver. 13. 14. Whenever he intends the flouriſhing of his Kingdom in the World, he hath reſidues of the Spirit to give out; the more Holineſs there is in Saints and Churches, the more there are of the pourings out of the Spirit: <hi>I will pour out my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon thy Seed, and they ſhall ſpring up as among the graſs, as Willows by the Water-courſes,</hi> Iſa. 44. 3, 4. So Joel 2. 28, 29. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48427:34"/> 
                  <hi>upon all Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. In thoſe days, that is, in the time of the Goſpel, and eſpecially when the <hi>Jews</hi> are called.</p>
               <p>Again, as King, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Power to protect and rule his People, to govern and ſubdue his Enemies. He is altogether compleat to enact his own Purpoſes, and to fulfill his own Will; for as God, nothing is too hard for him; <hi>He takes up the Iſles as a very little thing, Iſa.</hi> 40. 15. It is an eaſie thing with him to blow off the Nations, and ſubdue all the Powers that oppoſe him: <hi>He that ſitteth in the Heavens ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall have them in Deriſion, Pſal.</hi> 2. 4. He makes nothing of all the Powers of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; it is but to look through the Clouds, and trouble their Hoſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. One Angel can ſuddenly deſtroy thouſands of them: he hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power over all Creatures to bring down all his Enemies, where and when he will; <hi>and he muſt reign till he hath brought them all down, Heb.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a Rod of Iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel, Pſal.</hi> 2. 9. The Saints are ready to tremble when they conſider the Potency of their Enemies; but it is far eaſier for Chriſt to daſh all the Powers of the World in pieces, than for a man to break an earthen Pitcher: <hi>He will order and eſtabliſh his Kingdom with Judgment and Juſtice, Iſa.</hi> 9. 7. It is not for want of Ability in Chriſt to order and perfect the Obedience of his Church and People, that there are ſuch Diſorders found amongſt them; only he is pleaſed to leave Irregularities for a while, that he may come at laſt with his Fan, and purge them: So neither men nor Devils can
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48427:34"/> pluck his Sheep out of his hand, <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 28. Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may touch them; Temptations may wound and buffet them, and ſometimes Captivate his People; but they cannot remove them out of his hand; he will ſtill ſupport and preſerve, all that the Father hath given him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In this perſonal Union of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, lies his Mediatorſhip: In theſe two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he takes upon him, and undergoes the Office of Mediator. And this is ſo great a deep, that time is too ſhort to give a full Diſplay of the Glory of Chriſt's Mediatorſhip. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>But now he hath obtained a more excellent Miniſtry by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now &amp;c.</hi> That is by vertue of this Union of both Natures in the Perſon of Chriſt, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Mediator of a better Covenant; this we may ſee, if we look back in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of Chriſts divine Nature, who is ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in Heaven; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. his humane Nature is ſhewn, called the Miniſter of the Sanctuary, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to offer Gifts: and having ſpoken of Chriſt in both his Natures, he tells us that he is now become a Mediator, betwixt God and Man; a middle Perſon, a days-Man, he hath a Mediety or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs of Nature, as God-Man, and is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in regard of his Office, in which Office, the Lord Jeſus ſtands in a double Relation, firſt, to God, ſecondly, to Man; having both Natures, he is intereſted in both parties, the Son of God, and the Son of Man, one with God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 30. <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> of one Nature, one Will, one Delight, having one Deſign and one Glory.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48427:35"/> As man he is of the ſame Nature, Fleſh and Blood with fall'n man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. 14. 17. He hath the ſame Temptations, the ſame Weakneſſes and Infirmities with them (Sin excepted) that he might have a fellow feeling of the Infirmities of his people, and put on Bowels of Compaſſions, that he might be capable of fulfilling all Righteouſneſs, ſuffering for them, and holding Communion with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>This Term Mediator, is taken ſometimes in a more large ſenſe, ſometimes in a more ſtrict ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This Term, as it is taken in a large Senſe, ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a Mediator, as he is the Head, the middle between God and his Creatures, ſo he is the Mediator of Angels as well as men: It is by him the Angels were made, and in him the Elect Angels are choſen, and by him they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: for Angels cannot be thought to come to ſuch a State of Felicity, and ſuch near Union with God, but upon the account of a ſecond perſon, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. in the ſixteenth verſe, Chriſt is ſaid to be the Creator of Angels, and in this 20. ver. there's his Mediatorſhip for Angels: <hi>By him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all things to himſelf, whether they be things in Earth or things in Heaven.</hi> This is a place of very great Difficulty, and hath puzled many Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: ſome conceive it is to reconcile man and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels together, ſuppoſing the Angels were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to fallen man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, brought into a State of Amity: but it cannot be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood here; for the Parties reconciled, are not ſaid to be men and Angels, but God, and theſe things: how then is this underſtood? Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conceive, that this Reconciliation is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by way of Proportion and Similitude,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48427:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> not as if the Angels needed Pardon, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned; but they ſtand in need of a Mediator, that they may not ſin; for as Creatures, they are mutable, and as ſubject, in their Nature to ſin, as the Devils were; and it is by Jeſus Chriſt they are preſerved, and kept in the Favour of God. It is ſaid, all things in Heaven: The Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are, or ſhall be brought into a capacity of meetneſs, for the preſence of God, Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, by Jeſus Chriſt, as Mediatour: The Angels are called Elect Angels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. And how? but as they are choſen in Chriſt; for all Election is founded in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as a middle Perſon, as the Head of Election, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he hath choſen us in him;</hi> all thoſe Creatures that ſhall be made, or kept holy, are plac'd in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Likewiſe the Angels are call'd the Sons of God, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 7. <hi>When the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy:</hi> Now all Adoption is in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: If they are reputed as the Sons of God, this Relation muſt needs be in Chriſt, who is the onely begotten Son of God: therefore all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels muſt needs have dependance upon Chriſt, as Mediator, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of time, he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth, even in him.</hi> Some conceive it is meant of thoſe Saints that were in Heaven, before Chriſt came to ſuffer; but that cannot be, it being put in the Neuter Gender, <hi>All things in Heaven:</hi> ſo that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediator of Angels, in that he procures for them Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God: and were it not for a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48427:36"/> they would never be ſecur'd from Falling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, More ſtrictly. Chriſt is called Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in reſpect to God, and fallen Man, coming betwixt them, as a middle Perſon, to make up the Breach, effect a Peace, and reconcile them together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. He is the Mediator of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. <hi>And to Jeſus the Mediatour of the new Covenant,</hi> John 14. 6. <hi>He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life:</hi> It is through his Name alone Salvation is to be had, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. He is appointed of God the Father to this end, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation for our Sins:</hi> to be one that may reconcile God to Man, and render him propitious and favourable to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>For him hath God the Father ſealed:</hi> He was annointed and furniſhed with all Abilities for this end, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. And he is the onely Mediator, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5, 6. The onely Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. The onely Advocate, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. 'Tis God the Son, the Second Perſon, is the only Mediator; 'twas he that made man, and therefore fitteſt for him to re-make him; <hi>It would be a great derogation from Chriſts Honour</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtin) ſhould another mend and reform that ſpoiled work which he made.</hi> He is fitteſt to reſtore man to the loſt Image of God, who himſelf is the expreſs Image of the Father: 'Tis beſt meet for him to commend the Love of God to man, who himſelf is the Son of the Father's Love: He is the onely begotten Son of the Father, and ſo fit to Adopt others into a ſtate of Sonſhip. As Man alſo, Chriſt hath Right to Redemption-work, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 23. As God, he hath Ability to redeem; As Man he was capable to ſuffer: As God, he was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48427:36"/> able to bear up the Humane Nature under Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; As Man, he could bear the Puniſhment of Sin; As God, he could remove our Sins, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Natures: As Man, he could compaſſionate his People; As God, he could help them: As Man, he is capable to tender a Satisfaction; As God, to render it infinite: As Man, he was able to become a Sponſor, a Surety, to make a promiſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Seed; And, as God, he could make good his Promiſe: He can reveal the mind, and diſcloſe the deep things of God, and pour out the Spirit of Grace; He hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, and is able to ſave to the uttermoſt: He can exalt his Intereſt, and ſubjugate his Enemies under his Feet; He ſits at the Right hand of God, and is God with the Father, and Man with Man.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WE come in the next place, to ſhew wherein the Office and Work of this Mediator lies: And it will much conduce to the Glory of Chriſt, to diſplay his Mediatorſhip.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt conſider him in a double Relation. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath to deal with two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parties, where there is a Breach.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His Work lies with reſpect to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>
                  <item>2. His Work lies with reſpect to fallen Man.</item>
               </list>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48427:37"/>
               <p> Firſt, His Work lies with reſpect to God the Father: And here his Office lies in ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, One great part of the Work of Chriſt, as Mediator, is, to mediate in the behalf of fallen Man, with the Father, ſo as to procure terms of Reconciliation: Thus a Mediator is to agitate with the offended Perſon, to bring to terms of Peace: This was the Work of Jeſus Chriſt, from before all time; He did act with God the Father, that there might be a way found out for agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and poor Sinners. This was drawn up in the Covenant between the Father and the Son, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6, 7. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in Righteouſneſs, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the People, for a Light of the Gentiles: To open the blind eyes, to bring out the Priſoners from the Priſon.</hi> Here's the reſult of Chriſts Mediation in the behalf of fall'n Sinners: He doth treat with the Father, that he would be pleaſed to ſhew pity to fall'n man; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returns this Anſwer, That he will conſent to the terms of Jeſus Chriſt, for the ſaving of Sinners; that he ſhall be a Covenant for the People, and give out Salvation to periſhing Sinners: So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 5. to the 10 verſ. The Perſons for whom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt mediates, are Jews and Gentiles, and under theſe are compriſed all the Elect of God: And the Father treats, and concludes with Chriſt, about the ſaving of theſe two Parties: <hi>In an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have I heard thee, and I will give thee for a Covenant of the People.</hi> All the Elect of God, both among the Jews and Gentiles, ſhall be called and ſaved by this Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48427:37"/>
               <p> But what are the terms upon which the Father conſents to the Mediation of Chriſt, that there ſhall be Peace for all that come to him?</p>
               <p>Firſt, One thing concluded upon between the Father and the Son, is, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall make up the Breach of the firſt Covenant: There's a Righteous Covenant of God broken, by the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and upon the breach of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, God is bound, in Juſtice, to lay Death upon <hi>Adam,</hi> Condemnation upon all fall'n Mankind. Now, that this Bleſſing may be procured, which Chriſt mediates for, the Sentence of Death is to be reverſed; and this cannot be till the Puniſhment of the broken Covenant be borne. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt voluntarily undertakes to do this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come.</hi> All other ways were ineffectual to make ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin. Now, when no way could make up this Breach, then Chriſt comes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to pay the price himſelf, to be a Sacrifice for Sinners; <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will.</hi> What is the Will of God? Why, that Mercy and Juſtice be reconciled. Juſtice was all for Puniſhment; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice would not be ſatisfied till the Penalty was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: Now Chriſt muſt come in the Sinners room, and undergo the Penalty of this broken Covenant. Sayes God, <hi>In the day thou breakeſt this Covenant thou ſhalt dye;</hi> therefore Chriſt muſt come and dye. This is one of the terms; If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will be a Subſtitute in the room of the Offender, and undergo the Puniſhment, then he will take off the Condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>For Sin condemned Sin in the Fleſh,</hi> that is, in the Fleſh of Chriſt, Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied. The Law
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48427:38"/> could not do this: God ſends his Son, and he muſt undergo the curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. And this the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did conſent unto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another thing required is, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould obey the Precepts of this Covenant perfectly, in his own Perſon, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all his Seed: That God might have no Quarrel with the Children of the Covenant, Chriſt muſt dye to make up the former Breach of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: He muſt obey, to fulfill the End of the Covenant; he was not only to undergo Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but he was to complete all active Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and this the Lord Jeſus Chriſt conſented to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence he ſaith, <hi>It behoveth us to fulfil all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Mat: 3. 15. <hi>God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as Mediator, becomes obliged to the preceptive Law of God, and muſt in his own Perſon fulfil all the parts of this Law, and muſt work out a perfect Holineſs and Obedience, that the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant might be fulfilled, if Salvation be obtained.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another thing which the Father and Jeſus Chriſt agree upon, about this Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, is, That the firſt Covenant, to all its demands, being fulfilled, and there being nothing now to lay in againſt the Believer from this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; that Salvation may be ſure, he concludes to make a new Covenant; which, that it may be faultleſs, Jeſus Chriſt ſhould now become the Surety of another, and better Covenant. The firſt Covenant God found fault with, and therefore he thinks upon a ſecond, that may be effectual to all the ends of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation-grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8. <hi>For if that firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>

                  <hi>had been faultleſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond: for, finding fault with them, he ſaith, Behold, the dayes come, when I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of Iſrael and Judah.</hi> As if the Lord ſhould ſay to his Son, The firſt Covenant will never anſwer thy Propoſals, to ſave fallen Man, and that thy Seed may be bleſſed, therefore there ſhall be a new Covenant drawn, that ſhall be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the ends of Salvation; and thou ſhalt be the Head and Mediator of this Covenant; this was the agreement between the Father and the Son. Now Jeſus Chriſt becomes the Angel of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: God agrees with Jeſus Chriſt for fallen man: Jeſus Chriſt covenants with the Father, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all his Seed, that he will bring them to Life: He promiſes to work in them and for them all that is required to Salvation, and that they ſhall be ſaved to the uttermoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22, 25. <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made a Surety of a better Teſtament: wherefore he is able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt.</hi> Thus he becomes an Engager to the Father in the behalf of all Believers. O Friends! this is a glorious Myſtery; I fear too few are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted in the glorious Work of the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt becomes a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only to pay the Debt, but to perform the Condition. A Surety, or a Sponſor, is one that promiſes and undertakes in the behalf of another, to fulfill what he was bound to do. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath performed this firſt Office of a Mediator, by drawing up an Agreement between God and fallen Man, by bringing the Father to terms of Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The terms being thus concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48427:39"/> the ſecond part of this mediatory work of Chriſt is, that he actually ſet about this Obedience and Suffering, and make good the Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and himſelf; and this he did in the fulneſs of time; he comes and actually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhes all his Promiſes to the Father, in point of Merit and Satisfaction. There are two great things Jeſus Chriſt is to do, in order to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Promiſe to the Father, in behalf of his Seed: Firſt, meritoriouſly procuring the things for them; and Secondly, efficaciouſly applying what he procures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the new Teſtament, that by means of Death, for the Redemption of the Tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Covenant, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal Inheritance.</hi> There could be no Redemption of them that were bound an I caſt by the Statute of the firſt Covenant, but by Chriſts Sufferings; therefore Chriſt did actually lay down his Life a Ranſom for all his Seed. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for Sins the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us unto God.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>He hath made him to be Sin for us:</hi> By way of Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation and Agreement, he was made a Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he did actually undergo all thoſe Sufferings while he was on Earth, which was a full ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, equal, juſt, valuable, and proportionable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to divine Juſtice, all that it could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>in foro judicii;</hi> Juſtice hath nothing more to charge; the Extremity and Rigour of the Law was fulfillled; and whatever the Believer ſhould have ſuffered in his own perſon, was all born by Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Who gave himſelf a Ranſom.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Gomarus</hi> obſerves, ſignifies an equal-price
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48427:39"/> of Redemption, an Eye for an Eye, a Tooth for a Tooth, <hi>caput capite redimo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſt.</hi> So full is this Satisfaction made by Chriſt, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf well pleaſed. <hi>Math.</hi> 3 17. So great was the delight and Pleaſure that God took in his Sons Satisfaction, as that by an audible Voice from Heaven, in the Preſence of men and Angels, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges him, and gives him an Acquittance.</p>
               <p>Again, This Satisfaction muſt needs be full, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon the very Promiſe of this Ranſom, when the Concluſion was made between the Father and the Son, did the Lord let his Priſoner free, and give the purchaſed Poſſeſſion to the Seed of Chriſt, before ever Chriſt did fully pay the Debt: as much as to ſay, aſſoon as ever the Lord Jeſus Chriſt gave Bond for the payment of this Debt, the Father gives out the Fruit of it, and ſo all the Saints that were ſaved before Chriſt came, were ſaved by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Promiſe of Chriſt to the Father, fully to pay the Debt; and the Spirits of juſt men, were made perfect with God before Chriſt came into the World, upon the account of this compleat Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction afterwards to be made.</p>
               <p>Again, A Proclamation is ſent out from Heaven, upon the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, that now Peace is made for fallen man, upon the terms of Sinners coming to and receiving of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: now God would never have ſent forth this Proclamation from Heaven, had not the Satisfaction Chriſt made, been compleat and full. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 28. Come unto me, whoever you be, let your Burdens be never ſo great, your Weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs never ſo much, your Dangers never ſo many, come unto me, and I will give you reſt: thus he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48427:40"/> proclaims in the great Feaſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink,</hi> be he what he will, here's enough to ſatiate his Soul, if he comes; here's Redemption procur'd: And upon this, by the joynt Agreement of the Father and Son, a Commiſſion is given to a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, to preach the Goſpel and tender Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to loſt Sinners, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. <hi>And that Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Name among all Nations,</hi> Mark. 16. 15. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, go ye into all the World and preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> O Friends! Theſe are glorious things, if they be but believed. Tenders of Life muſt be made to all the periſhing World, that all may know, that this was a full and ſufficient Ranſom which Chriſt gave, and that the Father was compleatly ſatisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Again, Upon the Fathers actual Acceptance of Chriſts Redemption and Mediation, he doth give out begun Salvation to Believers, they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the actual Enjoyment of this purchaſe; ſo all Believers upon their Reception of Chriſt, have the Spirit of Chriſt given them, which to them is begun Salvation, a Seal of Glory, the firſt fruits of Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> Now ſeeing the Father, upon the receiving of this Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by Chriſt, delivers out Grace, and therein the Begi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nings of Glory, to all that ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſe with Chriſt, therefore this price paid by Jeſus Chriſt, muſt needs be compleat and full</p>
               <p>That's the ſecond thing that this Mediator doth, he doth actually pay down the price the Father demands, and this becomes a full Satisfaction to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48427:40"/> divine Juſtice, for every Soul that doth ſavingly cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another thing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth as Mediator, is this. By his ſhed blood, he ſeals to, and engages with the Father in the Behalf of Believers, that they ſhall abide with God in his Covenant, and ſhall no more wickedly depart from him: we have ſhewn before, that this was one of thoſe Terms agreed upon, between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son; that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be the Surety of another and better Covenant: and here the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtands actually bound for the Preſervation of all the Saints to Glory. O if Souls had this Truth let into their Hearts, it would wonderfully prevent many ſtumbling Blocks by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Unbelief: he ſtands bound to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a Sponſor or Surety, in the Behalf of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that he will work all in them, and for them, that tends to the Salvation of their Souls: for in this new Covenant, God doth not deal with man, but by a Surety; mans ſingle Bond will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſs more in the Court of Heaven; no, it was broken in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, and God made no more Covenant with man upon theſe Terms: there muſt be a Surety; hence he is ſaid to be the Surety of a better Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. So that that which is to be wrought in and by Believers, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt undertakes to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfill'd in us:</hi> That is, that Righteouſneſs which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, even a perfect Conformity to the will of God, might be fully found in Chriſt our Head, for us and in us, by way of Imputation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication through Faith; by vertue of the Union
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48427:41"/> between Chriſt and his Members, all the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Obedience, which was wrought in Chriſt's own perſon, as their Head, Redeemer, and Mediator of this new Covenant, is imputed to them as their Obedience and Righteouſneſs, and accepted of God the Father, as if it were done by them; and ſo it is fulfilled in Believers: ſo that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtands engaged to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the Obedience of all his Seed, that it ſhall be wrought in them, and for them, in Truth, and Sincerity. And he begins to place this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conformity to God, in the Soul, when he doth new create it in the Image of God; there is ſomething in every part and Faculty of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul, that correſponds and anſwers to the Holineſs of God, though but in Part and Degrees, in their Underſtandings, ſomething of the true Light of God: in their Wills ſomething of real Conformity to the Will of God: a gracious Soul would be holy as God is holy. O ſays the poor Believer, I cannot evidence that Holineſs I ſhould, but God knows, I would be holy, I would caſt off every Sin, I would perform every Duty in a right manner: ſo in the Affections, there is the Seed of divine Love to God, his Will, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; there is ſincere Love, though but in part, and imperfect: but ſeeing this Holineſs begun in the Saints in Truth, is but in part, and full of Spots; Chriſt comes, in the next place, and preſents his ſpotleſs Obedience in the Behalf of Believers, and by Vertue of this myſtical Union between Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Chriſt, this Holineſs of Chriſt is the Holineſs of Believers, and God accepts of it as their Holineſs: O if Souls did but ſee more into this,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48427:41"/> they would not take up all their ſtanding upon their own Legs, and ſee their Happineſs or Miſery lye in their compleat or incompleat Obedience, but they would ſee all Holineſs lye in Chriſt: hence you ſee the meaning of that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>By the Obedience of one, many are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> God looks upon ſincere Souls as preſented in Chriſt, that ſo far as Chriſt is holy, they are holy in him; for all the Obedience and Holineſs of Chriſt as Mediator, is the Obedience and Holineſs of his People; for what he did was not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for his people. And thus much of the firſt, how this Mediator deals with God the Father for fallen man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, deals with men the other party too. Now this he doth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As an Interceder to Sinners in the Behalf of God the Father, he comes and treats with men, by virtue of his Mediatorſhip, to draw and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to Terms of Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given us the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Reconciliation.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt comes as the Meſſenger of the Lord, and delivers over Counſel, and tenders God the Father to Sinners: this he doth in his perſon: verſ. 19. <hi>God in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf;</hi> By his Miniſtry, in opening the Goſpel to Sinners, diſcovering thoſe great Tranſactions between the Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the great willingneſs of God to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and inviting loſt Souls to himſelf. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>We pray you in Chriſt's ſtead be you reconciled to God.</hi> You ſee the Errand of the Goſpel to you,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48427:42"/> (Souls) and the Buſineſs of Chriſt in every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, it is to bring you to a willingneſs to accept of the Terms of Reconciliation, to come over to God by Jeſus Chriſt, that you may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By giving out the holy Ghoſt, by which Sinners are effectually called, and adopted into the Sonſhip of God; this is neceſſary in order to the Application of what the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath done in his own perſon, whilſt on Earth: he promiſed when he left the World, to ſend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in his Room, ſeeing it is of neceſſity, he muſt go away and take poſſeſſion of the Kingdom of Glory for his people, and muſt go within the Veil, as the great High-prieſt; therefore that this Work might go on in his Abſence, the comforter muſt come. <hi>Jo.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>If I depart I will ſend him unto you.</hi> And what ſhall he do? <hi>He will reprove the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and Judgment, verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>He will guide you into all Truth,</hi> verſ. 13. So that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſends the Spirit in the Goſpel, to make all the Adminiſtrations of it effectual, to ſuch as ſhall be ſaved. All that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can do, cannot remove the thick Veil, that is, upon the Minds of Sinners, we cannot give eyes to ſee, nor Ears to hear, it is the work of the Spirit, it muſt be an Almighty power, muſt open this two leafed gate, and let in Jeſus Chriſt into the Heart; it muſt be by the Almighty Power, and Energy of the Spirit, that the work becomes ſucceſsful to any Soul, we find it ſo. How many precious Sermons are caſt away upon flinty Hearts, they will not bow nor turn till the Spirit comes; therefore the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the exerciſe of his Mediatorſhip pours out the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>That we might receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through Faith. Gal.</hi> 3. 14. Or the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48427:42"/> promiſed Spirit through the Word of Faith; for Faith cannot be had till the Spirit be had: Faith comes by hearing; <hi>How received ye the Spirit, by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? Gal.</hi> 3. 2. There's no ſuch Commiſſion given at all to the Law, to give out the Spirit; it is by the hearing of Faith, by the opening this Box of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ointment, this bleſſed ſavour comes to Sinners: till that be done, no Converſion-work can be done; till the Spirit enters the Soul, Jeſus Chriſt cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Soul: the Spirit of Chriſt is the harbinger, and goes before, and makes way for this bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to come into the Sinners heart: the Spirit is tendred to all, but the Lord gives it to whom he pleaſes; for it is as the Wind that blows, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>So is the way of the Spirit:</hi> thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt gives the Spirit to all that come to him, and by this he carries on his Mediatory work.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another thing Jeſus Chriſt doth with reſpect to men, in the exerciſe of his Mediatorſhip; He applies his Redemption-work to all thoſe that do believe in him, he makes over himſelf, and all that is his, by a free Donation, to all that receive him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>If any man open the door, I will come into him, and will ſup with him:</hi> The great work is to get open this bolted door of the Heart to Jeſus Chriſt, and when the door ſtands open, and the Sinner conſents to take Chriſt, and eſteeming it a good Bargain to have him, upon the moſt coſtly Terms; then he makes over himſelf to the Soul, <hi>I will ſup with him,</hi> I will impart my Spiritual refreſhings to him, I will give my ſelf to him, he ſhall feed upon my Fleſh and Blood: we have an Overture made, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 6.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48427:43"/> 
                  <hi>I will give to him that is a thirſt of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely,</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. When once God hath brought the Sinner to a thirſt for Chriſt, to a ſenſe of his Miſery without Chriſt, that he cannot live without him; when the Sinner is perſuaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and give up himſelf to him; then the Lord Jeſus gives out himſelf, his Spirit, theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Life, the Waters of Regeneration; then he puts the Believing Soul into the poſſeſſion of Life and Righteouſneſs, of Grace, and an earneſt of Glory. He gives to ſuch, a Right and Title to all that is his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. He gives out to them the fruit of his Sweat and Bleeding, the fruit of his Groans and Dying, as they are capable to receive. He died that they might have Life, and have it more abundantly: He was made Sin for them, that they might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. And now he is performing this, and ſtrips the poor Soul of his filthy Garments, and takes away the filth of Original and Actual Sin, and comes and cloaths the Soul with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and puts his fair Ornaments upon it, and makes it as a fair Jewel in the ſight of God; and when the Soul hath beſpotted his own Garments, Chriſt comes and cloaths him with pure Rayment: So that here's alwayes Work for Chriſt to do for his People, whilſt on Earth, to apply the fruits of his Purchaſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in purſuing his Mediatorly Work, doth take upon him the Work of an Interceſſor in Heaven, and Advocates in the behalf of all his People; He hath done all that was needful for him to do on Earth, and now he is entred into the Heavens, and ſate down at
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48427:43"/> the Right hand of God, and ever lives to make Interceſſion for the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25, 27. That is his Work now in Heaven, to perform that part of his Prieſtly Office, as is needful for him to do, as a Mediator there.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is opened the glorious Advocateſhip of Chriſt, with the unſpeakable Comforts and Advantages thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are two parts of Chriſts Prieſthood; (1.) His Satisfaction. (2.) His Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The firſt I have ſpoken to already, and proved, That the Lord Jeſus, by his Active and Paſſive Obedience, hath ſatisfied the Law of God, and made a full Atonement for the Sins of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; that he underwent all that they were bound to undergo, and that in their Name, Room, and Stead, for their Sakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. This he did by his Active Obedience, and alſo by his Paſſive, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 28, 29. And by this one Offering of his, hath he perfected them that are ſanctified for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. by way of Merit; that God hath no more now to charge on Believers, by way of Puniſhment for their Sins, ſeeing Chriſt hath borne it in his own Body for them on the Tree. By this he hath obtained Salvation for them: that's the firſt part of his Prieſtly Work.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48427:44"/>
               <p> But, Secondly, Having diſpatch'd his Expiation, 'tis needful that he carry on his Application of this Obedience and Suffering to them; and this is done by his interceding in Heaven for them. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo much of the Riches of Chriſt lies in this part of his Mediatorly Work, and it is of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Concernment, as to the Faith, Comfort, and Advantage of Believers, therefore, I ſhall ſpeak the more fully to this Subject, and ſhall prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man, doth now ſit down at the Right Hand of God, Interceding there in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How the Lord Chriſt carries on this Work of Interceſſion in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For whom he doth intercede in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>What he doth intercede for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Why the Lord Jtſus Chriſt, as a Mediator, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on this Work of Interceſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>What are the unſpeakable Comforts and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that flow from this Interceſſion of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt doth now ſit down at the Right Hand of God, and is entred upon the Work of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two Arguments to prove this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The nature of the Office the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath undertaken now in Heaven: He hath taken on him the Office of an Advocate, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his People. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: This word is ordinarily rendred a Comforter, when applied to the Holy Ghoſt; but when ſpoken of Chriſt (as <hi>Gomarus,</hi> and other Learned men affirm) it is taken for an Advocate,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48427:44"/> or one that undertakes the Cauſe of another; an Atturney, or Officer at Law, that appears in Court for one that is there concerned and accuſed, to look after, and plead his Cauſe: He is one that is, by Law, deputed and ſet apart to that Office, and ſo is bound to do his utmoſt for his Client, as for himſelf: Thus is Jeſus Chriſt ſet apart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, by the Father, to this Office of Advocate and Interceſſor, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. <hi>For him hath God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſealed.</hi> That is, appointed, ſet apart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be Mediator and High-Prieſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 4. That he might ſatisfie for the Sins of his People, and ſue out the Benefits of it for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſts Fidelity in the Performance of this Work, proves he is now in Heaven, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding. He cannot be content to have a Name and no more; he is faithful in things pertaining to Men. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt did actually carry on this Work of interceding for his People, before he took their Nature upon him, and came into the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>He bore the Sins of many, and made Interceſſion for the Tranſgreſſors.</hi> Upon his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to this Office, and by vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be offer'd, he did, ever ſince the Fall, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate for his People, and put on Bowels for them. <hi>He carried them all the dayes of Old, Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. whilſt he was in Heaven, ever ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, aſſoon as he had any Seed on Earth. Again, Chriſt was faithful in this Work of Mediation and Interceſſion, whilſt on Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Who in the dayes of his Fleſh, when he had offered up Prayers and Supplications; with ſtrong cries and tears.</hi> Thoſe cries and tears he put up were for his People, not for himſelf, he needed it not: He was willing to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48427:45"/> be ſubject to his Fathers Will, to drink of the Cup the Father gave him to drink; But he prayed for the converſion of thoſe the Father had given him, and prayes for the Salvation of his People, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 19, 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. And this he doth now he is in Heaven; he carries on this Work there in his Humane Nature: <hi>He is entred into Heaven it ſelf, there to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 24. It is a Metaphor taken from an Atturney, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the behalf of his Clients: So Jeſus Chriſt is at the Right hand of God making interceſſion, by way of Office. When Satan or the Law doth accuſe Believers, there's Chriſt at the Bar, ready to make anſwer for them, to plead the Cauſe of his Clients, and procure their Juſtification: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that juſtifieth: Who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth? it is Chriſt that died; yea rather, that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34. So Heb. 6. 19, 20. <hi>Which Hope we have, as an Anchor of the Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth into that within the veil; whither the Fore-runner is for us entred, even Jeſus, made an High-Prieſt for ever.</hi> By an entrance within the veil, was typified out Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Glory. As the High-Prieſt entred within the veil, ſo Chriſt, as an High-Prieſt, is now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to carry on Redemption-work: He is there to oppoſe all Deſigns againſt his People, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them againſt all the Impleadings of their Enemies; He ever lives to make Interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. The word ſignifies, to attain the Mark, as an Archer doth; or he that throws Darts hits
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48427:45"/> the Mark, ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt intercedes ſo as to prevail.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>How doth Chriſt intercede in Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt doth not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede in Heaven, <hi>Figuratively,</hi> As if his Interceſſion were no more but the vertue of his Merit, as <hi>Abel's</hi> Blood is ſaid to ſpeak, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. But formally as one that takes upon him the Cauſe of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſuffering people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he doth not intercede <hi>Charitatively,</hi> by way of Courteſie and Kindneſs, which he might do or leave undone, as he pleaſeth; but officially by way of Office and Truſt committed to him, for ſo he is our Advocate, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Neither doth he intercede <hi>Precario,</hi> in ſuch an humble manner and Mode of Supplication of bowing the Knee, and ſubmiſſive Intreaties with Cries and Tears, as the Saints do, and as once he did whilſt on Earth; for this is inconſiſtent with that State of Majeſty and Glory, he is in at the right hand of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. But <hi>Authoritatively,</hi> by way of Right and Power, as one that hath depoſited a ſufficient Price, and now demands his Captives, as one that hath made a Purchaſe, and now requires the thing purchaſed, as one that hath deſerved what he moves for, and hath Power, as God, to beſtow:</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> and ſo.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt's Interceſſion in Heaven is, by his appearing there for us, as our Mediator and Surety, preſenting his perſon, God-man, as our Agent and High-prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. As the High-prieſt of old did appear in the holyeſt of all, with the Names of the twelve Tribes on his Breaſt and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48427:46"/> Shoulders, for a Memorial before the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 9. to 22. to which, ſays one, the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Set me as a Seal on thy Heart, as a a Seal upon thy Arm,</hi> as a Manifeſtation of his Love; ſo Chriſt's interceding, is his appearing in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his People, as their Advocate; and Chriſt's ſitting in Heaven, in this Relation to his people may be calle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his interceding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By preſenting his Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings before the Father on their behalf, that they might have the Benefit of it, and that God would in Juſtice, communicate the Fruits of it to all his Seed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. A type of this we might ſee in the High-prieſt's bringing the blood of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice within the Veil, and ſprinkling it on the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Seat, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 11. to 17. Firſt he killed the Sin-offering, and then brought in the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord within the Veil; without which his Act was not compleat. Thus Chriſt firſt ſheds his Blood on Earth, for his People, then enters into Heaven, there to preſent his Blood for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By declaring his Willingneſs, that his People ſhould have all that Mercy and Salvation which they need, and that he purchaſes for them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be where I am;</hi> Father, I will that my Children have their due: 'tis true, they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but I have ſuffered, they have fallen ſhort but I have fulfilled all Righteouſneſs: thou knoweſt I obeyed for them, and dyed for them, that all which thou haſt promiſed might be made good to them: and Father, I will that Juſtice be done for them in Heaven; and I will, that this and the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48427:46"/> other Mercy be given out to them here, according as their Neceſſities and Capacities require: whilſt Chriſt was on Earth, he came to do his Fathers Will, and now he is in Heaven, he muſt in all things have his own, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 42.</p>
               <p>Thus much may be underſtood by the manner of Chriſt's Interceſſion in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>For whom doth Jeſus Chriſt intercede in Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For all that come to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. For all that do believe in him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20. Some deſponding Sinners may be ready to ſay, alas! this is not for me, I am unworthy of ſo choice a Mercy: will Chriſt plead for ſuch a grace-abuſing wretch as I? Why Sinner, if thou art one that comeſt over to Jeſus Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt on the Son, thou mayeſt lay claim to this Advocate in Heaven, and confidently expect the Benefit of his Interceſſion.</p>
               <p>Again, The Lord Chriſt intercedes for all his People on Earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>And now I am no more in the World, but theſe are in the World, holy Father keep, through thy own Name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me.</hi> The Saints on Earth are the Subjects for whom he intercedes: particularly, for his ſinning people: he made Interceſſion for the Tranſgreſſors. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. Some trembling Soul may ſay, Chriſt's Interceſſion is for them that are holy, but I am vile; but know, O Soul, Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeds in Heaven for his people that ſin againſt him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. Again, Chriſt intercedes in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his weak and impotent people, that are compaſt about with Clouds of Infirmities, he hath a ſpecial Reſpect to theſe, as a tender Father hath
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48427:47"/> to a weak Child; Chriſt's grace was ſufficient for <hi>Paul,</hi> when his own fail'd under the horrible Buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Satan,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. Such as are weak in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that know not how to pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or wait upon God in any holy Duty as they ſhould; theſe are the Perſons Chriſt pleads for to help them, ſuch as are ready to be overcome by Temptations; <hi>Simon, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as Wheat, but I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not,</hi> Luke 22. 31. 32. Poor tempted Souls, hurryed up and down, ſometimes aſſaulted with blaſphemous Thoughts, then poyſoned by ugly Temptations, put upon this Sin, and then the other Sin, every day the Devil following them with new Temptations, laying in new Batteries againſt them: Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, interceding for theſe.</p>
               <p>Again, Chriſt intercedes in Heaven for his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering People, ſuch as are in danger of being overcome by their Enemies, and have no Might, and none to intercede for them, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59. 16. Sore Judgments there were upon the People of God, and that juſtly; for their Tranſgreſſions, no Righteouſneſs of their own to plead for them, nothing at all that could juſtly intervene between Wrath and them: Now in this caſe Chriſt ſteps in, and he intercedes, and brings Salvation. Theſe are the perſons Chriſt intercedes for in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>What doth the Lord Jeſus intercede for in the behalf of his People?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, One thing he pleads for is, for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the World, and from the Evil of the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48427:47"/> 
                  <hi>take them out of the World, but that thou ſhould'ſt keep them from the Evil.</hi> This implies, Chriſt's mind is, his People ſhould continue in the World till their Work be done; that neither Sin nor Danger may cut them off till their full time be come; but that they may be kept from Evil; from the Evil of Temptation, and the Evil of Perſecution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He intercedes for the Sanctification of his People; and this is a glorious Priviledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth; thy Word is truth:</hi> By the word of thy Truth, make them partakers of thy Holineſs: <hi>For their ſakes. I ſanctifie my ſelf, ver.</hi> 19. I ſet apart my ſelf, now on Earth, as an High-Prieſt and Mediator: And why ſo? <hi>That they may be ſanctified through the Truth.</hi> It may be a poor tempted Soul hath beg'd for Grace, but finds no anſwer; as <hi>Paul</hi> prayed twice, thrice, many times without return; but Jeſus Chriſt intercedes, who will prevail; and becauſe he prayes, they ſhall obtain, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Chriſt, and in his time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt pleads in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for Believers Union with himſelf, and with one another, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 11, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Holy Father, keep, through thy own Name, thoſe whom thou baſt given me, that they may be one, as we are: That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> This he died for, to gather his People into one, and this he will procure in due time. Their Union with himſelf ſhall be inſeparable; their Communion may be interrupted, but their Union can never be broken. And it is a matter of Comfort to Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48427:48"/> that grieve for the ſad Breaches amongſt Saints, how that Chriſt intercedes in Heaven for their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who cannot be denied.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt intercedes for his Peoples Succour, and ſupport, under, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Temptation, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. <hi>I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee, that tby Faith fail not.</hi> Ah Soul! Art thou followed with new Temptations every day? Doth the Devil vex thee, caſting in wicked, vile thoughts, that do make thee tremble, pulling and haling thee? Fear not, ſayes Chriſt, the Devil ſhall not prevail. O, ſayes a Soul, What ſhall I do for Faith? I cannot take hold of this, and the other Promiſe. Why, Chriſt in Heaven pleads for Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that their Faith ſhall not fail, ſhall not ſink away, nor faint in the day of Temptation, <hi>He will not ſuffer you to be tempted above meaſure,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13. <hi>He will make a way to eſcape.</hi> As ſure as Chriſt himſelf hath eſcaped from Satan, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto Glory, ſo ſure ſhall Believers paſs thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo. O Soul! thou canſt not tell how to pray; this and the other wicked thought hurries thee; Faith and Hope, all ſeem to be gone: but, O, what a bleſſed thing is this, that there is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator in Heaven to pray for thee!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Jeſus Chriſt intercedes in Heaven for the Pardon of all the Sins of his People, and for the enjoyment of his Fathers favour, <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. That's part of Chriſt's Work in Heaven, to Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in regard of their Sins: So <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 26. <hi>That the Love with which thou loveſt me may be in them.</hi> I have purchaſed thy Favour for them, and Peace with thee, by my own Blood; therefore, Father,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48427:48"/> O take not away thy loving kindneſs from them: O, do not be angry with them for ever. O, what a wonderful Priviledge is this! Chriſt is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that his Father love them with an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and a common Love; but his Will is, that the ſame Love with which the Father loved Chriſt, as Mediator, be beſtowed upon them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt Advocates in Heaven for the ſupply of all the wants of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to the Riches of his Glory, by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Obſerve the ground, and meritorious cauſe of all the Supplies of the Saints Needs, is the Riches of Chriſt in Heaven; the Riches of Chriſts Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O! when the poor Believer goes mourning under a ſenſe of this, and the other Want, Chriſt in Heaven is interceding for them. O, ſayes one, I want a ſoft Heart; a Heart to love God: I want more power over Corruptions and Temptations: More Humility, ſayes another: O, my proud heart! I want more Patience; I am fill'd with the Fire of Hell: I want more Purity, unclean Thoughts lodge in my Soul: but Chriſt in Heaven is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for them, thus. Father, There's a Child of mine wants a ſoft Heart; I will that thou give it to him: there's another goes complaining for want of more power over Corruptions; I will that thou grant it to him: Another wants Bodily ſupplies; he is in ſtraits in the World, and knows not what to do; Father, thou haſt made me Heir of all things, and I will that thou give him ſome of mine Inheritance. O that Believers did know this! when they are pining away in their ſtraits,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48427:49"/> that they would look to Jeſus, and by Faith ſee him interceding for them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Another thing Chriſt pleads in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for, is, the ſubduing of all the Enemies of his People: Whatever is like to endanger their well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, in thelr work of glorifying God, and in their way to Glory with God, Chriſt pleads that it may be removed. Are the Snares of the World like to carry away one? the Snare of Proſperity, or vain Company, like to ruin another? Doth the Fleſh luſt againſt the Spirit, and ready to reduce it into Bondage? Chriſt pleads in Heaven for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of theſe Leviathans; and will, in his own time, bring down all the Enemies of his People: Yea, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and all the implacable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of <hi>Sion</hi> muſt be ſubdued, becauſe Chriſt intercedes for it, and Reigns till he hath put down all Enemies under his Feet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, He intercedes for his Peoples Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; He ſeems to be much concern'd in this, that his People be of good cheer in the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>Be of good cheer,</hi> Pluck up your Spirits, walk comfortably, <hi>I have overcome the World for you, I will not leave you comfortleſs;</hi> I will not leave you in danger of overwhelming: Chriſt takes care that his People be not overladen with trouble, but that they have comfort in due time.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt pleads for their thorough and compleat Salvation, for their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Grace, and their ſure and certain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Glory. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave to the utmoſt, becauſe he ever lives to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. Whatever their dangers, ſtraits, and hazards be, Chriſt intercedes in Heaven, for
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48427:49"/> their utmoſt ſaving, thorough all, and from all. The gracious Soul miſcarries ſadly, this, and the other time; in this, and the other matter: he falls dangerouſly, and bruiſes his Bones; but Chriſt pleads in Heaven, that this might not prove a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wound: <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, to behold my Glory, Joh.</hi> 17. 24. All his Glory, that he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his Blood, is for his People. As a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he gets a large Eſtate, his Children ſhall fare the better for it, he will leave it all to them; ſo Chriſt in Heaven intercedes, Father, I will that my Children may ſhare with me in my Glory; may Reign, and ſit on Thrones, and be crowned with Immortality with me. <hi>Where I am, there ſhall my Servant be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what Chriſt intercedes for in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Why doth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt intercede in Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe he hath undertaken this Work for his People: He is their Advocate, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. He is an Officer in Heaven for them, and hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken their Caſes; and being bound, he will be faithful: He is there, as their Fore-runner, and his Fidelity lies at ſtake, to make their way plain to Glory. If they come not after, how can he be their Fore-runner?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe of his Intereſt in them, they are very near to him, they are his own. <hi>Having loved his own, that were in the World, Joh.</hi> 13. 1. Perſons uſe to love their own. The World loves its own; therefore is Chriſt ſo concern'd in the welfare of his People, becauſe they are his Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48427:50"/> They are his Friends, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 14, 15. <hi>Ye are my Friends, I have called you Friends.</hi> And will not a man concern himſelf about his Friends? There's never a man on Earth, that hath a Friend ſo near his heart, as the Saints are to the heart of Chriſt; They are his Brethren; <hi>He is not aſhamed to call them Brethren, Heb.</hi> 2. 11. He is their Elder Brother, and they are younger Brethren, and he cannot but have a tender heart towards them. How full of Bowels was <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his Brethren, though they had ſold him, and injured him; yet how affectionately did he diſcover himſelf to them, he wept, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> heard him? <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. It is a moſt affecting Story, to ſhew what the heart of a Brother is, or ſhould be. O, how much is Jeſus Chriſt concerned in the welfare of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!</p>
               <p>Again, He is their Father; He hath the Bowels of a Father: He pleads in Heaven, at the Right hand of God, as a Father doth ſpeak for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. O! if a man had a Child, or ſome Children, condemn'd to dye, how would a tender Father ſpeak for them, and weep for them, that they might not dye! with ſuch Bowels doth Jeſus Chriſt plead for his People in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Again, They are his Spouſe, his Love, his Dove, married to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. And can a tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Husband ſhut up his Bowels towards his own Fleſh? So Chriſt, in Heaven, accounts nothing too dear that might be for the welfare of his People, becauſe of their conjugal relation to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe of the great Love he bears to them, therefore will he make Interceſſion for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In his Love and pity he redeemed them.</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:48427:50"/> Nor men, nor Angels can tell the Height, Depth, Length and Breadth of the Love of Chriſt; it is Love, paſſing Knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18. Chriſt's Love to his people, is unconceivable, unchangeable: many waters cannot quench it, all their Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot diminiſh it, therefore he remembers their Concernments, and pleads their Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe of the Sympathy the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath with them, he hath a fellow-feeling of all their Infirmities and Afflictions: as he is their head, he cannot but ſympathize, with all the Maladies and Diſtempers of every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; he is the high-prieſt, and muſt have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>For we have not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:</hi> He cannot be capable of Inſenſibility, of the Caſes, Concerns and Conditions of his people; Weakneſſes, Sins and Wants, whatever becomes the Burden of his People, it is near his Heart: It is not his own Glory in Heaven, can take off his Thoughts and Care of them: He that abuſeth the Saints offers Violence to Chriſt's Eye, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of his Eye.</hi> While he was in Heaven, in the Poſſeſſion of the Fathers Glory, no ſooner did their Cry come up from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but preſently it reached his Heart; God tells <hi>Moſes</hi> he could not ſtand ſtill to hear the Complaint of his poor afflicted people: God in Chriſt, the ſecond perſon, the Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant reſents the Miſeries and Afflictions of his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 23. 24. <hi>I have ſurely ſeen the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of my People which are in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and have heard their Cry, and I am come down to deliver them, Exod.</hi> 3. 7, 8. And if he was ſo pityful, as to be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48427:51"/> ſoon afflicted with the Afflictions of his people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he aſſumed the humane Nature upon him, is he not as much now ſith he hath taken our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, and ſtands in Heaven cloathed with our Body and Soul? <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 2. Chriſt carries no Weakneſſes to Heaven with him, he hath no kind of Wants, Pains, nor Sorrows, but he is compaſſed with Infirmities, that is, a Senſe of the Weakneſſes, and Remembrance of the Afflictions and Infirmities, whilſt he was here: He knows the Heart of a Stranger, he knows what it is to be under the Wrath of God, therefore cannot but have a fellow-feeling of the Infirmities of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. No tender Mother can be more affected with the pain of a little ſucking Child, with the Fear of loſing it, than Chriſt is with the caſe of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore he pleads for them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Jeſus Chriſt cannot chuſe but ſpeak for his People in Heaven, becauſe he hath purchaſed them, he hath bought them, and paid for them: he thought it fit to lay down a very great price for every believing Soul, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>You are bought with a price.</hi> He was willing to have his Heart opened, and his Side opened, that he might let out his Blood for them; and ſurely he cannot but be willing to intercede for them, when he was willing to dye, and bear divine Wrath for them: he hath bought Grace and Glory for them, and he muſt needs ſpeak, that they might have what he hath paid for. It is true, if God ſhould deal upon the account of Creature-deſervings, they would ſoon be totally deſtitute: but though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in themſelves, Chriſt pleads his Worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Father, I will, that thou give out this and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48427:51"/> the other Mercy to them, I have purchaſed it for them: it is true, they have abuſed the Goſpel, and ſinn'd away the Light of thy Countenance; but I will that thou ſpeak comfortably to them for my ſake; for I have always obey'd thee, and done thy Will.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Becauſe of his Promiſe to them, he hath promiſed he will not leave them, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 18. I go away, ſays Chriſt, but I will not leave you; I go to Heaven but it is for you; I carry your Names on my Heart, that I might think upon you, when I am in Glory: when I ſee how <hi>Satan</hi> buffets and aſſaults you from day to day, then I look upon the Palms of my hands and ſee your names engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there, <hi>and will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come again to you.</hi> He ſends his Spirit to keep them Company here on Earth, and he will come and fetch them home at laſt; he will be faithful to them in all things, that pertain to God, and for the Salvation of their Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may urge him with his Promiſe and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and this obliges Chriſt to do all he can for them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Becauſe of the great Neceſſity they have of his pleading for them; He ſees they would be undone if he did not ſtand up for them. <hi>Satan</hi> would lay in his Accuſations, he is the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, and what ways he hath to accuſe the Saints before God, we know not: he accuſed <hi>Job,</hi> and doubtleſs he is ever and anon laying in freſh Charges againſt the people of God; therefore Chriſt pleads for them: he ſees they want Grace and want Strength, therefore he cannot be ſilent: he ſaw <hi>Peter</hi> had need of Support, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31, 32.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48427:52"/> therefore he prayed for him: Chriſt ſees they ſtand in need of Promiſes, Experiences, Conſolations and Priviledges, therefore he pleads in Heaven for them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>What are the Comforts and Advantages that flow from the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's Cauſe of wonderful Joy and Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Believers, when they caſt their believing Looks towards Heaven, to ſee their Advocate there.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard of the Excellency of this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: O! what a glorious, mighty, and potent Friend, have Believers to plead for them; he is no mean perſon, he is the Son of God, <hi>the expreſs Image of his Fathers Perſon, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. He is one that made the World, and upholdeth the World, and after he had ſuffered for Sin, he is gone to Glory, and takes his Seat at the right hand of the Majeſty, on high; he doth not ſtand by as a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but ſits down on the Throne, by the Fathers ſide, and ſpeak as a Friend for them: O what a glorious and tranſcendent perſon is he! it is not an Angel, it is not a Saint, but it is the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, Jehovah Chriſt.</hi> O when the Believer, by Meditation, comes to reflect on his Glorious Agent in Heaven, how he is honoured by Angels, Saints, and every Creature, it will wonderfully conſolate his Languiſhing Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the Succeſsfullneſs of this Interceſſion, and it cannot but yield much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>the Father heareth him always, Joh.</hi> 11. 42. The Father and he are one, of one Nature, one Glory, one Will: what the Son wills the Father
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48427:52"/> wills; and Jeſus Chriſt is the Executor of his own Will, and hath all Power in his hands to give out, and perform what he pleads for: What would'ſt thou have, Soul? Lord, ſayes the Soul, I would have more Grace, be more holy, have ſtrength againſt this, and the other Temptation: I am afraid I ſhall periſh under theſe Blaſphemous Thoughts. Oh, the horrible injections of Satan! Lord, ſupport me. Why, (ſayes Chriſt) Fear not, Soul, In me is Everlaſting ſtrength, thou ſhalt have it in my time, and according to my meaſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider the extent of Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and that will contribute wonderful Joy to Believers: His Favour is not narrowed up to one or two Favourites, but for all his Saints: <hi>All that come to God by him, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>All that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, Joh.</hi> 17. 20. Chriſt excepts none: In this he out-goes the Affections of all Creatures. It is rare for the largeſt Affections of Men, not to run within ſome narrow limits; but Jeſus Chriſt hath an equal reſpect for all his Seed. And then he intercedes for them in all their Matters, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In all their Affiictions he is afflicted:</hi> There is no part of their Trouble but he is concern'd in it: As Chriſt is an Advocate in Heaven, he is engag'd to attend the Concerns of his People, though they ſhould neglect him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 18. He is privy to all their Matters: How ſhould this revive the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul? It is the uſual complaint of Souls, O, I fear Chriſt will not intercede for me; I am ſo Carnal, ſo full of Deceit, Hypocriſie and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings. It is true, He takes pleaſure in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his People; but, I fear, I am none of his. They that pray and plead Spiritually may hope,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48427:53"/> but I cannot pray, nor look up. But let me tell every poor trembling Believer, There's never a Soul that hath the Lord for his God, that Jeſus Chriſt can be unmindful of: He intercedes for all his People, and in all their Concernments.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This may yield wonderful Comfort to Believers, to conſider, That Jeſus Chriſt doth not onely intercede in Heaven, in their Names, but in their very Natures: He preſents the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in his own Perſon, glorified; and in this Nature he pleads to God for them. He is ſet forth as <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. He cannot but be full of Pity and Compaſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is of the ſame Nature with them: <hi>They are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones,</hi> Eph. 5. 30. O, if that Scripture were but put into the Believing Meditation of Believers, what Comfort will flow from it? O trembling Saint! thou mayeſt object thy Unworthineſs and defiled Nature; but Jeſus Chriſt hath thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glorified now in Heaven, at the Father's right hand.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The reſtleſneſs and unweariedneſs of Chriſts purſuing the Bleſſedneſs and Salvation of all his Seed, is that which may yield wonderful comfort to the Believing Soul. Conſider his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Diſpoſition, whiles he was on Earth: <hi>His Spirit ſhall not fail, till he hath ſet Judgment in the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 42. 4. And if Chriſt was ſo earneſt to undergo ſuch work then, and was ſo reſtleſs and active till it was done; ſurely he muſt needs be reſtleſs to carry on this Work now in Heaven: <hi>He lives ever to make Interceſſion, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. There are ſome times when men on Earth cannot agitate the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48427:53"/> Cauſe of their Friends; but Chriſt is alwayes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about this Work of Mediation: Chriſt's Authority is capable to manage all the Affairs of his People, were they millions of men, therefore it muſt needs be matter of wonderful Comfort to Believers, that they have ſuch a Mediator in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Conſider the Advantages that flow from this Interceſſion of Chriſt to Believers, and it will yield matter of wonderful comfort.</p>
               <p>Their Sins ſhall be ſurely pardoned. O what wonderful comfort is this! <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe Sins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. He is an Advocate for them, to take away their Sins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7, 9. No Bill ſhall be laid in againſt them at the Bar of God: Who dares accuſe that Soul that is covered over with the Blood of the Redeemer? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>Their Perſons and Performances ſhall ſurely find acceptance with God, through this Interceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Who hath made us accepted in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi> All that glorious Chain of Mercy that is made over to, and faſtned upon the Believer, hath its tye to Jeſus Chriſt: Predeſtination, Adoption, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sanctification and Salvation, are all laid upon Chriſt. It is a piece of uſual weakneſs in poor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or rather Doubting-ſouls, to judge of their Acceptance with God, or Non-acceptance, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Deſervings, or ill-deſervings, and the nature and frame of their Spirits and Duties: when they have been drawn out in Frames, and wonderfully rais'd in Duties, they think now they ſhall find Favour; But it is not that which gives
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48427:54"/> your Suits Entertainment in Heaven; it is as God accepts the Soul in Chriſt, notwithſtanding all the Failings and Infirmities of Believers; they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with a <hi>well done good and faithful Servant,</hi> upon the account of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, They are ſure to be ſecur'd againſt the prevailing Power of all their Enemies; let <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> with all his Train and Forces be united againſt them, he muſt be broken to pieces; for Chriſt is at the right hand of the Father, interceding for them: <hi>Sin ſhall have no Dominion over them,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. <hi>God will bruiſe</hi> Satan <hi>under their Feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 16. 20. Hence it is, they may be ſure none of their Enemies ſhall prevail, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74.</p>
               <p>Again, They may be ſure to receive more Grace, and Life more abundantly, <hi>God giveth more Grace, James</hi> 5. 6. whilſt Chriſt's Intereſt holds in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whilſt he hath a Fullneſs of Grace to beſtow, Believers may expect more.</p>
               <p>Acceſs to the Throne of Grace at all times in his Name, is another procured Advantage of his Interceſſion; it is by the Blood of Chriſt Believers come to God with Boldneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>Hence the Blood of Chriſt makes Peace, and an open door for Believers to approach to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 12. Becauſe he is there at the Throne of Grace, he will open his Door to his Children, and let them in, within the Veil: what tender Mother would ſhut the door againſt her weeping Child?</p>
               <p>Again, They have not only Acceſs to the Throne of Grace, but Succeſs; they ſhall ſpeed when they cry with all their Hearts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. 14. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48427:54"/> 
                  <hi>you ſhall ask in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son: if you ſhall ask any thing in my Name, I will do it.</hi> Chriſt was leaving his Diſciples, and they might tremblingly diſpond, how ſhall we live when thou art gone? the World will perſecute us, and <hi>Satan</hi> will devour us? Why ſays Chriſt, I will protect you then, as well as now, and hear your Requeſts: you think it is only your Concernment, to have your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers anſwered; no, it is the Concernment of my Father too, his Glory lies at ſtake for it. O! what bold Encouragement is this <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3, 4, 5. Prayers aſcended up, and preſently comes down Thunders, Noiſes, Lightnings, and Earth-quakes: as a Symbol of God's Reception: believe it, Saints have ſtill as great Potency with God, on the Account of Chriſt, as ever, and their right Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall ſurely find an anſwer at the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>Again, They ſhall certainly have Perſeverance in Grace: for the Certainty of a Believers Graces depend not upon his own Strength, that it ſhould dye if he ceaſe to exerciſe it; but is ſecured by the Interceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40.</p>
               <p>Another Effect of Chriſt's Interceſſion is this, The Saints have Oneneſs with and an Intereſt in the Love of God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 21. 22. And they ſhall be ſure of Grace and of Glory: they ſhall have a Manſion in Heaven, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, to behold my Glory.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing the Willingneſs of Chriſt, that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould be ſaved, the Sin and Miſery of ſuch as refuſe Chriſt, with Reproof to ſeveral ſorts of Perſons</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have a little opened the Tranſcendent Glory of Chriſt as Mediator, wherein ſo much of his vaſt Treaſury lies: we come now to make ſome Application of this glorious point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By way of Information. Firſt, How won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully are poor Sinners indebted to the Lord for giving ſuch a Mediator as Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man; none elſe in Heaven or Earth could have procured the Salvation of loſt Sinners: had he been God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he had had neither Right or Capacity to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: had he been only Man, he could never have born up under the dreadful weight of theſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; Death would have had Dominion over him, his Sufferings unſatisfactory, his Interceſſion reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all the hopes of Sinners periſhed; but now he is able to ſave all that come to God by him: O admire at, and rejoyce in this Love of God, in giving Chriſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Life and Liberty Health and Strength, Peace and Plenty, are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mercies; but the giving of Chriſt is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently ſuper-eminent: Can you bleſs the Lord for lower Springs? O adore theſe upper ones, this Grace that brings Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48427:55"/>
               <p> Secondly, See the Willingneſs of Chriſt, that Sinners ſhould be ſaved, he would never elſe have aſſum'd the work of a Mediatour, nor have given himſelf for this very end that Sinners might be brought to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. He would never have undertaken the bloody way of Death, nor drunk off ſuch a bitter tremendous Cup, that Sin had brewed for him; he would not have interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with God for Terms of Reconciliation, nor undergone ſuch direful, unconceivable Torments, had he not been willing Sinners ſhould live: hath Chriſt ſo carefully prepared the Miniſtration of Reconciliation, and abſolutely commanded the Promulgation of the Goſpel to every Creature? <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. Hath he laid ſuch a Neceſſity on his Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors, and oblig'd them, by the Penalty of fearful Woes, to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and he is not willing that Sinners ſhould be ſaved? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. See how he charges his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be inſtant in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, to reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all Long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Kindneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. To perſwade and beſeech men to be reconciled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. 20. And will he reject them when they come? He would not have griev'd and mourn'd ſo much at Sinners Unbelief, and out-ſtanding the day of Grace, had he been unwilling they ſhould have liv'd, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41. 42. Behold how he waits till the laſt hour of the Day, and treats his Enemies with an affectionate Kindneſs, why will you dye, O Houſe of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> He heaps up Coals of Fire on their Heads, and draws them with Cords of Love, and with the bands of a man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 4. he offers Violence by his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48427:56"/> Spirit, to unwilling Souls, and attempts the moſt charming Perſuaſions to allure them to him; he thunders and lightens, as on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and threatens them terribly if they will not come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. Ah troubled Souls, you that tremble, leaſt he will no more have Mercy on you; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject your Selves and Duties, ſhut up his Bowels, and harden his Heart againſt your Cries. Ah! do but conſider and ſeriouſly reflect on what Chriſt hath already done and ſuffered for you, think on his Carriage whilſt on Earth, and his tender Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of all that came to him; he debarred none, ſurely, then his Advancement in Heaven, produces no Alteration in him: it may enlarge his Capacity but cannot ſtraiten his Bowels to periſhing Sinners. Honour doth not puff him up, or make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of their Concernments; think upon his Promiſes, he will caſt out none that come to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. Let their Sins be as red as Scarlet, he will make them as white as Wool, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 18. He knows the Heart of a Stranger, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 29. He remembers what 'tis to lye under the Pangs of a troubled Soul, when he trode the Wine-preſs of his Fathers Wrath alone; and therefore cannot but compaſſionate the Miſerable, and thoſe that are conſumed with the Terrors of the Almighty. Ceaſe Soul, to lay thy Charge on Chriſt, 'tis thy own Unwillingneſs and Unbelief that impedes thy way to Life, not his.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How fearful then is the Sin, and how dreadful will be the miſery of all thoſe that refuſe this Mediator, will not hearken to this Prophet, nor conſent to his Propoſals for Salvation: The Tongues of Men and Angels are not capable here
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48427:56"/> to commit an Hyperbole, nor can ſuch themſelves ſufficiently conceive it, till they feel it. Ah, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! Weigh a little theſe enſuing particulars, and you will find it true.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a moſt aggravated Sin, and hath all the circumſtances of Evil in it: There's no ſin of ſo deep a Dye, and foul a Guilt.</p>
               <p>It is a ſin againſt the higheſt Mercy, and greateſt Deeps of Divine Favour. There were ſome Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Mercy that God expended on the Gentile World: In the times of their Ignorance God did wink at them, feed them, and cloath them; But the Treaſures of Grace were reſerved for the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Time, the Goſpel dayes. O wretched Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff! By refuſing Chriſt, thou kickeſt againſt the moſt ſounding Bowels, againſt rich Mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. Againſt tender Mercy, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 18. Againſt Free Mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>It is a Sin againſt, and a forſaking of thy own Mercy: Thou ſtabbeſt thy own Soul with the ſame Dagger thou flingeſt at Chriſt. O wretched Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! thou takeſt pains to ſhut thy ſelf out of the door of Mercy, and to argue thy ſelf into the depth of Miſery: <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> Oh Sinner, thou ſheddeſt the blood of thy own Soul, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 9.</p>
               <p>It is a ſin againſt the choiceſt and coſtlieſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that ever God prepared: The Garment God made to cloath thy Soul, is dip'd in Blood, and this thou throweſt from thee. How juſtly will thy Soul rot in chains of Darkneſs to all Eternity, that refuſeſt ſuch a chargeable Remedy laid out upon thee? The Law was but leading to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. Had you liv'd to ſee the Prieſts killing the Sheep
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48427:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Lambs, and cutting the throats of theſe poor Creatures, to make an Atonement for Sin, you would have ſaid, ſurely the Antitype muſt needs be bloody: All thoſe charges men were at in their daily Sacrifices, could not take away one Sin; the Blood of Chriſt muſt do it. O expenſive Mercy! And this thy Soul deſpiſeth: O curſed Sin! All other Diſpenſations could not make thoſe that uſe them perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. Nor all the World, if ſold, can pay the Debt of one Soul, or the price of one ſin.</p>
               <p>It is a ſin againſt the moſt glorious Majeſty that ever was, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. Thou ſpitteſt in that Face that is infinitely above all Spots and Stains; that the Angels admire and adore; one Smile of which maintains all the Life and Conſolation of the Saints in Glory; this Jeſus thou deſpiſeſt. O unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner! where wilt thou go to hide thy ſelf from the wrath of the Lamb at the laſt day?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, 'Tis a rejection of thy own Duty, a throwing Chriſt out of his own Vineyard, and how will God deal with ſuch? <hi>He will miſerably deſtroy theſe miſerable men, Matth.</hi> 21. 41. The Lord Jeſus Chrſt hath Right to rule thee, and thou reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Homage thou oweſt to him, and deſpiſeſt his lawful Right and Authority which is a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sin indeed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis a moſt unreaſonable Sin, there's no Plea at all will bear in the Court of Reaſon for ſuch a Sin; thy own Reaſon will judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thy Soul. O! that ever thou ſhouldeſt chuſe Death rather than Life, and take the Iron Rod of <hi>Satan</hi> over thee, and deſpiſe the golden Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt; Ah! Sinner, there's cauſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48427:57"/> why thou ſhouldſt leave thy Luſts and wicked Companions, and depart from the Chambers of Death, in which thy Soul hath dwelt ſo long, but none at all why thou ſhould'ſt not come over to Chriſt: what doth Chriſt propoſe to thee that thou can'ſt cavil at? Is it to leave thy Luſts? If not, theſe will ruine thy Soul; if thou had'ſt Fire in thy Boſom, thou would'ſt think it reaſon to caſt it out; if Fetters upon thy Feet, and Clogs about thy Body, to ſhake them off; if a Serpent in thy Boſom, to caſt him out: O Sinner, ſit down, and conſult with the Principles of Reaſon, never was a better Bargain offered thee. Think on it, What if the Gate ſeem ſtraight, it is not ſo to thy Soul, but to thy Luſts, thou can'ſt not ſhun Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but muſt meet with it either here or to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'Tis a moſt condemning Sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. This will juſtifie the ſevereſt Doom of God, that they might have Life, but would not: Salvation came home to them, but they turn'd it off. O Sinner, take heed how thou refuſeſt him that ſpeaks from Heaven, deſpiſe not Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As 'tis the greateſt Sin ſo 'tis attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greateſt Miſery. For firſt, it opens the Windows of Vengeance, and lets down divine Wrath on thy Soul; it takes off all Poſſibility of Salvation; he that ſhuts up this door leavs none open to Life, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. Chriſt is the only Way, the Truth, and the Life, no poſſibility of eſcaping Wrath to come, if thou refuſe the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Heh.</hi> 2. 3. Don't flatter thy ſelf with Hopes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mercy; if thou give Chriſt a final Denial, all hopes of Mercy is gone, when once Chriſt who
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48427:58"/> is the Bleſſing, is gone from thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There's no Acceptance of any of thy duties, 'tis his Righteouſneſs and Interceſſion makes way for thy Acceptance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. All Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of the beſt Services of any, is through him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. None of thy Complaints or doleful Cries, can ever enter into Gods Ears, if they be not mixt with the Odours of his Incenſe: Ah Sinner, thou flattereſt thy ſelf with this, that thou wilt pray, cry, and weep upon a Death-Bed; Ah! what are all thy Cries, when God hears not?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there's ſure Damnation waits for thy Soul, the Devil ſtands by, and expects the time when Chriſt will take his final leave of thee. O Sinner, if once thy time be gone, and precious Overtures of Grace do ceaſe, then certain Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine follows: as ſure as the Work-man's wages is due to him, ſo will Damnation be to thy Soul, that doſt live and dye in thy Refuſal of Chriſt; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul that will not hear this Prophet ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, all the precious Interceſſions of Jeſus Chriſt will be turn'd againſt thee; and this is a moſt doleful Conſideration, enough to make the hardeſt heart to break: now while there's hope, the blood of Chriſt pleads, Father, wait a little longer for this Sinner; when divine Juſtice ſays, ceaſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding. that I may take Vengeance on this wretch; no ſays the blood of Chriſt, ſpare this Drunkard, a little longer, O wait one day longer, one year longer, for this Swearer: but upon thy final Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of Chriſt, the blood of Chriſt pleads another w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48427:58"/> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 34. <hi>This Child is ſet for the Fall and Riſing again of many in</hi> Iſrael. Chriſt is for the Fall as well as the riſing of many; and believe it, his blood hath as great a Vertue to heighen the Damnation of willful Unbelievers, as ever it hath to further the Salvation of Believers; and O what a dreadful thing is this, when the blood of Chriſt ſhall plead againſt thee. It may be upon thy Death-bed, thou wilt cry, Lord pardon me, Lord let me never go to the place of Torment: but the Blood of Chriſt will ſay, Father, damn him, he made me wait ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days and Years, and would not let me into his Heart, Father let him periſh; and whom do you think the Father will hear? This is one of the moſt trembling Conſiderations that I know, to heighten the Wrath of Sinners: that Soul muſt needs go deep into Hell, that the Blood of Chriſt ſends thither; the blood of Chriſt cries for Vengeance: Ah! Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners think of it, what a fearful thing it is to refuſe this Mediator: the Lord open your Ears, and the Lord work upon your Hearts that you may turn and live while there is Hope.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Hence ſee whence 'tis that the Prayers of any are ſo prevailing with God: what is it that makes Faith and Prayer ſo omnipotent? 'Tis the Interceſſion of Chriſt in Heaven that wings our Prayers, and makes them ſo ſpeedily arrive at the Mercy-ſeat, and come off with an anſwer of Peace. 'Tis a Friend in the Court of Heaven that makes the Saints Sutes ſo prevailing with God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3, 4, 5. 'Tis his Incenſe makes way for the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Saints, and then Fire comes out of the Cenſer, and burns up the Enemies of Chriſt:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48427:59"/> O there's wonderful Mightineſs in the prayers of the Saints whom Chriſt favours with his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Of <hi>Confutation.</hi> If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be the Great and onely Mediator between God and Man; then this will ſtrike down that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, damnable Errour of the Papiſts, Of <hi>Praying to Saints,</hi> and ſetting up other Interceders beſides Chriſt, making Addreſſes to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her in the Throne with Chriſt. If there be but one Mediator, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. and one that liveth to make Interceſſion, and that the Aſſurance of Salvation depends on this Interceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. Then 'tis a damnable Errour of the Papiſts to pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as they do in their Miſſal: one of which is thus; <hi>O Virgin, the onely chaſte Mother, looſing our Sins, give us the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for thou art Queen of the World, art able to do all things, and, with thy Son, diſpoſeſt all things.</hi> Another is, <hi>That God, by the Prayers and Merits of the ever bleſſed Virgin, and of all Saints, would bring us to the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Amen. Nay, they ſay, <hi>That Prayers made to, and delivered by the Saints, are better than thoſe by Chriſt;</hi> So <hi>Sal.</hi> Now, if Chriſt be the only way to the Father, and Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is through him alone, then this is a falſe Way, and never of Gods appointing, but blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sacrilege, and horrible Robbery of the very Flower of Chriſt's Crown: Nothing plucks the Scepter out of Chriſt's Hand, his Crown from his Head, as theſe irreligious Opinions of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> If Prayer be an act of Worſhip, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10. then 'tis onely due to God: Indeed there's a civil Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip due to Superiours, but Religious Adoration is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48427:59"/> God's Prerogative. If we muſt truſt on him to whom we pray, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13, 14. then we muſt pray to none but God, in Chriſt; for, curſed is the man that truſteth in man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5. He to whom we pray muſt be able to know our wants, and our Hearts; to ſee our Miſeries, and hear our Prayers. Now this the Saints in Heaven cannot do: <hi>Abraham is ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknowledgeth us not,</hi> Iſa. 63. 16.

Thus we may ſee the Heterodox Aſſertions of the Papiſts, in making many Mediators.</p>

               <p>Firſt, To ſuch as are no more affected with this great and glorious Privilege of having an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father. Ah! Did Souls but know what an Ocean of Privileges, and Fountain of Mercies is compriſed in this one Mediator, Jeſus Chriſt, it would fill their Hearts with Joy, tip their Tongues with Praiſes, and make them more glad in the Salvation of God. But, it may be, you are more affected with your Frames, fine Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and your own Duties, than with the Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Jeſus Chriſt. This deſerves a ſharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
               <p>2dly, Such as make little Uſe of the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. Alas! how few employ Chriſt about their Matters in Heaven, and engage him in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous and weighty Matters of their Souls? May not Chriſt complain ſtill, as once, on Earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. <hi>You will not come to me that you may have Life.</hi> 'Tis ſad indeed, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48427:60"/> ſo coſtly an Office, and pay ſo dear for a Right to do thy Soul good, and thou neglect to uſe him after all: This is the condemnation to Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners, That they turn their Backs upon the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. Alas, Soul! Are not thy wants great, and thy Sins many? thy Provocations and abuſes of Mercy daily, and yet wilt thou not engage Chriſt for thy help, to procure thy Pardon, and Paſſage from Death to Life? O, how juſtly miſerable will thy caſe be, who might'ſt be happy, but would'ſt not! <hi>He is worthily miſerable</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>that will not be happy for the asking.</hi> Who knows but that thy hard heart might have been ſoftened; thy filthy heart cleanſed; thy covetous heart ſpiritualized, and thy captivated Soul ſet free from the damning Power of Sin and Satan, had'ſt thou but improv'd a Mediator in Heaven? Know, Soul, if ever Life and Salvation be obtained, it muſt be by a Mediator.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here's a Reproof to ſuch as make Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators of their Duties; that truſt their Prayers more than Chriſt, and lay all their hopes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining on the act of ſeeking. Indeed the Promiſe of having is made to asking, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 7. but not for asking. Thy Matters (ſaith <hi>Luther)</hi> do not depend on the worth of thy Self, or Prayer, but ſolely on the account of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. It is Prayer in his Name: And therefore (ſaith <hi>Luther) Nulla Oratio extra Chriſtum. There is no Prayer at all out of Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis the Altar that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies the Gift, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>Our very Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are as filthy Rags,</hi> Iſa. 64. 6. <hi>When you have done all, you are unprofitable Servants,</hi> Luke 17. 10. <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name give</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing, what Conſolation flows to Believers from the Interceſſion of Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be the onely Mediator between God and Man, then here's Comfort for Believers in ſeveral Caſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To weak Believers; ſuch as need Mercy, and are unable to beg it as they ſhould. Poor Soul! Art thou ſenſible of thy urgent Neceſſities? that thy Wants are more than can be numbred? Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou the Hardneſs, Pride, Filthineſs, and Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of thy Heart? underſtandeſt thou thy need of the Spirit of Grace, and the Gifts of Grace, but canſt not pray for ſupplies ſo underſtandingly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, affectionately, and believingly as thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and therefore feareſt, ſhalt never find an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or obtain any reviving comfort to thy Soul, in the believing view of Chriſt's Interceſſion in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Let me tell thee, deſponding Chriſtian, thou canſt not be really poor, and pray in Faith; thou canſt not periſh for want, and have a Jeſus in Heaven interceding for thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Him the Father heareth alwayes, Joh.</hi> 11. 42. If the matter
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48427:61"/> depended upon thy own Oratory and Eloquence, thy Caſe were ſad; but there is one in Heaven that is wiſe, mighty, merciful, omniſcient, who minds thy caſe, conſiders thy needs, hears thy groans, knows thy diſtreſſes, and ever liveth to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But, ſayes a Soul, <hi>How ſhall I know that Chriſt intercedes for me, who am not worthy to lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Table, nor crawl at his Feet; I fear he hath greater concernments upon his Heart than to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Reſolution in this, look back to Chap. 4. where is ſhewn for whom Chriſt intercedes. He prayes for all that believe in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 15. Art thou one that believeſt in Chriſt? Haſt thou choſen him as thy Lord and Righteouſneſs? And is he precious to thy Soul? Could'ſt thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with all for him? Pleaſures, Profits, and Worldly Grandeur, are they nothing, when they come in competition with him. Canſt thou not ſay, O! None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt; Chriſt with Poverty, with Diſgrace, with Bondage and miſery, is far more preferrable than Riches, Repute, Liberty, and Mercies without him? Doſt thou conſent to all his terms? and art thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take up his yoke, and to learn of him? to bear his Croſs, and follow him? to leave all, and come to him, and that conſiderately, and from thy whole Heart? Doſt thou caſt and adventure thy Soul, and thy All, upon his Ability to ſave thee? Believeſt thou all that the Scripture reporteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him? his Perſonal Excellencies, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Sufficiencies? That he is able and willing to ſave all that come to God by him, and will not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48427:61"/> caſt out any that really come? And in this hope art thou reſolved to truſt thy All upon him, and if thou periſh, to periſh at his Feet? Then art thou that Soul for whom Chriſt intercedes in Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 5. <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Mark,</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But I cannot pray as I ought, according to the Will of God. Alas! how cold, dead, ſpiritleſs are my Prayers? and will God hear me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 'Tis not for thy name thou art heard, but for the Name of Chriſt; as you have already heard, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26, 27. <hi>We know not what to pray for as we ought.</hi> Neither I <hi>Paul,</hi> nor you believing <hi>Romans,</hi> know how to pray as we ought. If thou wanteſt words, yet if thou haſt ſighs and groans, thy Prayers are heard through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, Thou ſayeſt thou canſt not pray accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Will of God.</p>
               <p>I Anſw. 1. If thy Prayers are for ſuch things as God requires, for things that concern his Glory, and the good and Salvation of thy Soul; and for theſe outward things, as God ſees needful for thee: If thou prayeſt for theſe, as God promiſeth them, for Spiritual bleſſings abſolutely, and for others, with ſubmiſſion to his Wiſdom and Will; if thou ſeekeſt theſe onely in the Name of Chriſt, and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately for the Glory of God; with all thy Heart, and with all thy Strength, thou askeſt aright, and God will grant thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God in his infinite Grace, through Chriſt, accounts thoſe things in his People that are not, as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. He judges his People to be what they would be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>I know</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48427:62"/> 
                  <hi>thy Works, and Tribulation, and Poverty, but thou art rich.</hi> The Lord judgeth of his People, not ſo much by their Frames, inherent Qualifications, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Performances, but by their real Sincerity, and unfeigned deſires, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 9. Thou complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy Prayers be cold, and dead, heartleſs and lifeleſs, but doth this pleaſe thee, or trouble thee? Is not this the burden of thy Soul? that which thou mourneſt over, prayeſt and ſtriveſt againſt? Doth no Prayer content thee, but what is ſpiritual and fervent, affectionate and upright? Why, poor Soul, chear up thy ſelf, God eſteems thy Prayers ſuch, through Chriſt, as if they were ſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Procurement of thy needed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, doth not depend upon thy Prayer-frames, or the Modes and Meaſures of thy Holineſs, but on the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. Pray, weigh that Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 14, 16. <hi>If you ſhall ask any thing in my Name, I will do it. And I will pray the Father.</hi> (Any thing) that is, any thing you abſolutely need; Any thing that is fit for you to ask and me to give, I will do it. He doth not ſay The Modes of your Prayers, the meaſures of your Frames and Holineſs ſhall do it; but if ye ask, though with broken Language, and troubled Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, Sighs and Groans, I will do it. You have but one Advocate with the Father, I will word your Requeſts, and perfume them with my Incenſe; not the Excellency of your Duties, but the Worthineſs of my Interceſſion, ſhall procure your needed Mercies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here's Comfort to troubled Believers, ſuch as are in the depth of Soul-miſery, and caſt down with the ſight of their Sins, guilt of their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48427:62"/> Conſciences, and Fears of their Condition, that go mourning all the day long, forget to eat their Bread, feed on Worm-wood and Gall, refuſe (with <hi>Rachel)</hi> to be comforted, becauſe their firſt born, their Comforts, firſt Love and Holineſs are not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 15. This is the caſe of ſome poor Souls from day to day; they meet with no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, eat Aſhes in ſtead of Bread, and mingle their Tears with their Drink; they go from Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Ordinance, and their Fear come and go with them; they feel little Change by all they do, or enjoy, their Hearts are har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, proud, vain, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, unbelieving, hence they fear they are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and ſhall be caſt away to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Now here's Comfort to ſuch from Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in Heaven, he is there pleading thy cauſe, and preſſing after thy cure; thou haſt provoked God, but he is appeaſing his Wrath, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2. 1. 2. Thou art angring God every day, but he is always pleaſing him for thee; thou art making Breaches upon the Law of God, and he is there cloſing up thoſe Breaches by his Blood and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; thou art buſie making wounds upon the Glory of the Father, and Chriſt is there preſenting the deep Gaſhes, and bloody Stroaks his Juſtice laid upon him for thoſe very Sins: when God is reſolv'd to be aveng'd for thy Backſlidings, Chriſt is then diſcovering his conſtant Obedience, and upright Faithfulneſs for thee, he pleads with the Father thus, <hi>Father, ſhall thy Anger burn for ever, and thy Vengeance always wax hot againſt this Soul, My Child? Remember what I have borne for him, I have already ſuffered for his Sin, and given a plenary Satisfaction to the Demands of Juſtice, and wilt</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48427:63"/> 
                  <hi>thou charge it on him? Father, let his Sins be on me,</hi> as David, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>Let thy hand I pray thee, be againſt me, theſe Sheep what have they done? 'Tis I am their Surety, and in thy Account the Offender; I have anſwered for their Offences, and diſcharged their Debts, why wilt thou purſue them in thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Holy Father, in Juſtice ſpare theſe Offenders; behold them in my Blood, and cloathed with my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Obedience, and Suffering; 'tis true, their Natures are vile, but mine is holy, and they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of my Fleſh and of my Bones, they are diſeaſed but I have undertaken their Cure, and will preſent them to thee without Spot and Wrinkle.</hi> And this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt ſhall certainly prevail with God for thee, that thy Iniquities may be pardoned and thy Sins remembred no more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. All that is promis'd in the new Covenant, Chriſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for in Heaven; for he is the Angel of the Covenant <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. The Mediator of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. But the Forgiveneſs of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sins, is part of the new Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 18. where God forgives one Sin he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives them all, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 8. <hi>I will cleanſe them from all their Iniquities, &amp;c.</hi> He will pardon not only Sins before, but after Grace; not only ſmall but great Sins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 11. Not only Sins that have been once, but often committed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Return ye back-ſliding Children, and I will heal your Back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</hi> He doth not ſay once or twiee, but let their Back-ſlidings be never ſo great and many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Return God will pardon them; nay though they be as Scarlet, and as red as Crimſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:48427:63"/>
               <p>Object. <hi>I did once hope that God had pardon'd all my Sins, but now I fear it, becauſe I have back-ſliden after Mercy, and wallowed in Sin after waſhing, and God threatens he will not forgive ſuch, Jer.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The Reaſon why God would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their Sin, was not becauſe they were too great for Pardon, but becauſe they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 7. <hi>I will deſtroy my People, becauſe they return not from their Ways, Jer.</hi> 23. 14. The Lord promiſeth to ſuch as have gone aſide from his Ordinances, even from their Youth, that if they will return to him, he will return to them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If God will pardon all their Sins, then he will pardon their Relapſes after Mercy, be they never ſo great, upon their returning to him; God ſpeaks indefinitely, I will cleanſe them from all Iniquity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If God will pardon their Sins before Grace, much more thoſe after Grace; if he will forgive them when Enemies, then much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled; the Apoſtle uſeth the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. 9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If there be no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, then God will ſurely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all their Sins, that ever they commit: for there is never a Sin, but will condemn the Soul if it be not pardoned; but the Soul that is in Chriſt, is never, no not one Minute of time in a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If the Lord Jeſus ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Laſtly, If the Lord ſhould not pardon all the Sins of his People, he would be unjuſt and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. but that he cannot be, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 5, He will not do Iniquity, he is the faithful one that cannot deceive or be deceiv'd, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 21. Let God be true, and every man a Lyar.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here's Comfort to Believers, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the ſenſe of their ſtrong Corruptions, and unſubdued Luſts; The Body of Death in ſome doth make them doubt the truth of Grace, and fills their Lives with Bitterneſs and Terrours: The badneſs of their Hearts, and vileneſs of their Natures, makes ſome conclude their final Ruine; But here's Comfort to ſuch.</p>
               <p>Firſtly, In that it hath been and is the caſe of the deareſt Children of God, their Corruptions, like the Sons of <hi>Zerviah,</hi> have been too hard for them. <hi>Abraham</hi> accounts himſelf <hi>Duſt and Aſhes, Gen.</hi> 18. 27. <hi>Job</hi> cries out <hi>I am vile, Job.</hi> 40. 4. <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Mine Iniquities are gone over my head, as a Burden too heavy to bear, Pſal.</hi> 38. 4. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> from a reflex View of God's Glory, concludes he was undone becauſe a man of unclean Lips, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48427:64"/> 4, 5. And the Church, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64. 6. profeſs they were as an unclean thing. <hi>Paul</hi> an elect Veſſel, a man of ſingular Revelations, yet laments that in him dwelt no good thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. That he was carnal and ſold under Sin, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and when he would do good evil was preſent with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here's Comfort, that their Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in them ſhall not break their Covenant Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 30. to 35. There can be no Forfeiture of this Promiſe, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi> Thy Lye cannot make God untrue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3. 4. Thy evil Eye cannot make his Eye evil too, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 15. Thy wicked Thoughts cannot alter his gracious Thoughts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 8. 9. Thy invincible Corruptions cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Mercies, nor the Enmity of thy Nature make God thy Enemy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is employed in Heaven about this very Work of ſubduing thine Iniquities, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes ever, and why? That this People might be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17. That they might have more Grace, and the Spirit given out to mortifie their Corruptions; he reigns in Heaven on purpoſe to bring down his and their Enemies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25. He carries on the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven, and what is that but to ſet his People free indeed: he hath an aſſured care now in Glory to fulfil his Promiſes, one of which is that Iniquity ſhall be ſubdued, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Romans</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt's promiſe to the Father, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the Deſtruction of thy Sin, he is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to preſent his people compleat to the Father,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48427:65"/> 
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 27. and to keep them unblameable to his heavenly Kingdom, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His Glory and Pleaſure is concerned in the Death of thy Corruptions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>The Pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> What is this Pleaſure of the Lord? It is the Redemption of his People from the Tyranny of Sin, and the Slavery of <hi>Satan,</hi> into the glorious Liberty of the firſt born of Glory, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Grace is of a prevailing Nature, and muſt deſtroy thy Luſts at laſt, and the Spirit of Grace is in his people, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 20. the Intereſt of Sin and Sinners cannot always ſtand before the Intereſt of God and his people, <hi>Eſther</hi> 6. 13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Here's Comfort to tempted Believers, ſuch as are always dogged with filthy and frigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temptations, reſtleſsly haunted with vile and blaſphemous Thoughts, and miſerably buffeted with dreadful and dangerous Suggeſtions: if Chriſt be interceding in Heaven, then ſurely he will one day or other, put an end to all the Temptations, and in the mean time over-rule them, that they ſhall not prevail over thee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi> Chriſt is a merciful High-prieſt, and wants neither Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Bowels or Abiliiy, which might render him capable to relieve the tempted; he hath the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Serpent, the roaring Lion in Chains, and will mercifully ſay to that proud one, come ſo far, and no farther.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Here's Comfort to Gods people under their Afflictions and Sufferings in the World, or by the World; if Chriſt be interceding in Heaven for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48427:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> them, then ſurely he will not leave them comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in their Sufferings for him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 16. 32. 33. Then Tribulation, nor Perſecution, nor any thing elſe can ſeparate them from the Love of God in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. He that is for them is ſtronger than all that are againſt them, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erſ.</hi> 31. He will be with them in the Fire and in the Water, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 2. Chriſt is never ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than when the World is moſt bitter to a Child of God; Afflictions can but file away the Ruſt and ſcoure away the Filth, it cannot diminiſh the, Grace, nor injure the State of thoſe that are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in Chriſt's Mediation; Chriſt's Cordials are never better, than when his people are moſt faint and languiſhing: Chriſt in Heaven, laughs at the vain hopes of his Enemies, and will daſh all their Attempts againſt himſelf and Intereſt in pieces, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 4, 9. He will ſtrengthen his tyred, diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Servants under Sufferings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. His Arm is made bare, his Power diſplay'd and his Strength made perfect in their Weakneſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 14. This may be the Trouble and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Fears of ſome, how they ſhall hold out-in times of Tryal. I am afraid (ſays one) I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bare Reproaches, Hatred, Bonds, Loſs of Goods, and death for Chriſt, with a magnanimous and Goſpel Spirit: Why Soul? It ſhall be given thee in that hour not only to believe, but to ſuffer for Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. The Fury of the Adverſary ſhall not terrifie you, nor their rampent Rage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject your Courage. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 4.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Here's Comfort to ſuch as are Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for <hi>Sion,</hi> and grieve at the Afflictions of God's People: That lament to ſee Chriſt's Intereſt on
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48427:66"/> foot, and the Wicked on horſe-back, Tranſgreſſors to proſper, and the Godly afflicted, that weep to behold Divine Providences thwarting his Promiſes. The Lord hath promiſed, that to Chriſt ſhall eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knee bow, and every Tongue confeſs. Men read of glorious things ſpoken of <hi>Sion;</hi> but when they look to the Intereſt of God, they ſee nothing but matter of trouble and grief. They look to the Earth, and behold Darkneſs and Confuſions; they look to the Church of Chriſt, and lo, Decayes and Dyings: Now this breeds trouble to the Friends of Chriſt, to ſee things run counter, and croſs to expectation and promiſe: yet here is Comfort from the Interceſſion of Chriſt on this account. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Lord Jeſus ſits at Helm, he is upon the Throne, and reigns as King for ever; and this hath been the Faithful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Refuge and Support in the worſt of Times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 2. 4. 16. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 29. 10. The Lord Jeſus hath the Government of Nations, as well as of <hi>Sion,</hi> on his ſhoulders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. He rules over all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 19. <hi>His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ruleth over all.</hi> Men and Devils cannot wreſt the Scepter out of his hands: In ſpight of all he is King of <hi>Sion, Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. and his Government is maintained in all the Confuſions that are on the Earth; and if ſo, there is no cauſe for the People of Chriſt to be dejected. <hi>Fear not,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Caeſar</hi> to his Mariners in a Storm) <hi>Caeſar is here. Why are ye ſo fearful,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to his Diſciples, when trembling at their Dangers in a boyſterous Storm) <hi>O ye of little Faith, Matth.</hi> 8. 26. That Veſſel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſcarry that hath Chriſt at Helm, and if it could (ſaid <hi>Luther) mallem ruere cum Chriſto quam regnare cum Caeſare.</hi> I had rather periſh with Chriſt than reign with <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:48427:66"/>
               <p> Secondly, His Paths are in the deep waters, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 19. <hi>Thy way is in the Sea, thy paths are in the deep waters, and thy foot-ſteps are not known.</hi> The Pſalmiſt alludes to that Providence of God in leading <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the red Sea; when Deaths were on every hand, God walked on thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and made a way through them for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So <hi>Nah.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>The Lord hath his way in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm and the Clouds are the duſt of his Feet.</hi> Thoſe ways that men cannot ſtand up in, are Gods uſual walks, in which he leads on his Work and Intereſt. His wayes are above our wayes, and, <hi>In the Mount will the Lord be ſeen, Gen.</hi> 22. 14. His Providences, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 16. are like a Wheel in the middle of a wheel, and a skain of Silk ſtrangely entangled. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was come near the Borders of the promiſed Land, they muſt be turned back again into the Wilderneſs, and wander up and down forty years in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts: When Sion's Mercies were come to the Birth, they prov'd Abortive; Strange indeed is the Womb of Divine Providence, and ſeemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to Humane Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, No croſs Providences can hinder Chriſt's Work in the World: He hath purpoſed, and will perform it. Combinations of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 1, 2. the Gates of Hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. and the Powers of this World can no more impede the Succeſs of Chriſt's Work, than the Barking of Dogs can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Moon's paſſage to its Journey end, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 13. <hi>I will work, and who ſhall let it? Who art thou, O great Mountain, before Zerubbabel? thou ſhalt become a plain,</hi> Zach. 4. 7. <hi>He taketh up the Iſles as a very ſlender thing;</hi> Iſa. 40. 15. The Lord brings in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48427:67"/> his mightineſs here, to comfort <hi>Iſrael</hi> under Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, by reaſon of Difficulties in the way of their Mercy. <hi>Comfort ye my People, ſaith the Lord,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>Tell her her warfare is accompliſhed,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, that bringeſt good tidings, lift up thy voice with ſtrength:</hi> Be not afraid of Dangers, preach my Word, be undaunted in my Service: <hi>Behold your God,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>He will come, and his Reward with him,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>He will feed his Flock like a Shepherd,</hi> v. 11. He will keep up his Word and Ordinances in ſpight of all oppoſition. <hi>Obj. But our Enemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s are many.</hi> Anſ. Why, he hath meaſured all the waters of oppoſition in the hollow of his hand, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. Obj. <hi>But all our wiſdom cannot ſee how theſe great things ſhould be brought about.</hi> Anſ. Why, who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord? <hi>ver.</hi> 13. He wants not wiſdom to accompliſh his Work. Obj. <hi>But Nations and Iſlands combine againſt God's Iſrael.</hi> Anſw. What if they do? they are no more to God than the drop of a bucket, and the duſt of the Balance, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Therefore, fear not, he will perform his Promiſes, and fulfil his Deſigns. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why, what hath he promiſed? <hi>Anſw.</hi> He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that the ſtone cut out of the Mountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, ſhall become a great Mountain, and break in pieces the Image of the Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 35, 45. and that he will ſet up the Kingdom of his Son in the World, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p>He hath promiſed Peaceful times to the Church of God, when the Sword ſhall be turned into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 13. <hi>Great ſhall be the peace of thy Children: None ſhall hurt or deſtroy in all God's holy Mountain, Iſa.</hi> 65. 25. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 24, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 9.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:48427:67"/>
               <p> He hath promiſed times of Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 9. chap. 52. 8. ch. 54. 13. ch. 60. 19, 20.</p>

               <p>He hath promiſed times of Union, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 19.</p>
               <p>He hath promiſed times of Joy and Comfort to his Intereſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 13, 14. ch. 35. 10. ch. 25. 8.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, As thoſe great and glorious things are ſpoken of <hi>Sion,</hi> ſo they ſhall certainly be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in due time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 35. <hi>The Viſion is but for an appointed time, Hab.</hi> 2. 3.

The ſelf-ſame day; the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors ſay it was mid-day, as ſoon as one hundred and thirty years was out, to an hour, God fulfill'd his Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, God takes uſually the moſt unlikely time to fulfill his Promiſes: As in <hi>Abraham,</hi> when his Body was dead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 10, 11. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> were ſenſible of an utter inability and unfitneſs in themſelves for ſuch a Mercy, yet then was the Promiſe fulfilled, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 14.

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Exhortation to Sinners and Saints.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be ſuch a Glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, then,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let periſhing Sinners be perſwaded to get an Intereſt in him: And for Motive herein, conſider theſe four or five things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Lord Jeſus will Mediate for, and ſave none but thoſe that are his. Many common Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Favours, and Boons he beſtows on his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but Salvation-bleſſings are the priviledges only of his People, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 68.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Many will lay claim to Chriſt, who have no Intereſt in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25. High Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48427:68"/> may be ſhaken off, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>chap.</hi> 25. 12. Some that ſhall think themſelves ſomething, may be found nothing; ſome that ſhall be thought Saints by others, may yet be caſt away, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. As <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. The <hi>Galathians</hi> and ſcattered Saints, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 12. Nay the very Elect ſhall find it hard to ſtand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is but a time in which Chriſt may be found, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found;</hi> intimating, there is a time in which he will not, when the door will be ſhut, and Chriſt will ſpeak, knock, and call no more; There is but a day of Grace, an hour of Salvation, O Sinner be not wiſe too late.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is a moſt dreadful, tremendous thing, to leave the World without an Intereſt in Chriſt; to be ſummon'd to Judgment and have nothing to help them, no Mediator to plead for them, no Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to cover them, no Duties to accompany them, no Eye to pity them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 30. 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 5. This is ſad indeed, when all Bowels are gone, and boundleſs Miſeries to be undergone.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Of all periſhing Sinners, ſuch as periſh under the Goſpel, have the moſt dreadful Miſeries, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 21. 22. The Heathens and Pagans, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Harlots, ſhall have a more tolerable place in Hell, than ſuch as refuſe a tender'd Jeſus: <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation? Heb.</hi> 2. 3. O miſerable Sinners! ſleight not, Salvation tenders, deſpiſe not, Goſpel calls, but haſten away to this Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let the People of God be exhorted, firſt to bleſs God for this Mediator, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. Chriſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48427:69"/> is the Fountain of Bleſſings, the Author of Salvation, the Gift of God, and have you no <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s for the Enjoyment of ſo rich a perſon? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Ply hard the Throne of Grace, find Work for Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15, 16. <hi>Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace,</hi> make known your Requeſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. Conſider Soul,</p>
               <p>You have always need of Mercy; not a Moment but you want Supplies from God for Soul and Body: your Corruptions are alwayes reſiſting the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. never at peace with Grace, but as a Bow that is bent, are ſtill preſſing after their former Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as Waters penn'd back, are ſtriving to force their way; therefore Chriſtians, you alwayes need the Spirit's help, and freſh Supplies of Grace: your Guilt is always encreaſing, <hi>James</hi> 3. 2. The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falleth ſeven times a day, hence daily Sacrifices were appointed, becauſe of daily Sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. Your Temptations are continually renewed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. New Tryals are daily falling on you, new Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties are frequently occurring your Life, new Troubles and Afflictions are conſtantly betiding you.</p>
               <p>This is God's appointed way, in which he will give out Mercy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 7. 'Tis true, ſometimes God hears before we ask, but yet prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy doth not excuſe from Duty, and we have no ground to expect Mercy out of the way of Duty.</p>
               <p>You are inveſted with a holy Prieſt-hood, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that you may be much employed in this Work, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. Your Work and Offices lies in this, to offer up daily Sacrifices to God by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus waits in Heaven to receive your Prayers, 'tis his Buſineſs and work in Glory, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue your Advantages, and therefore he expects to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48427:69"/> hear from you, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 24. As an Agent that expects to hear from his Clyent, and receive Intimation about his Condition; as a Friend in a forreign Country, that is hearkning for Letters from his Friend, Chriſt in Heaven deſires to hear from his People on Earth; not that he is ignorant of them, or needs to be put in Remembrance, but this way are his Graces in them exerciſed, their Love and Duty maintain'd, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf glorified, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 18. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious.</hi> In the Original it is, he longs and as it were, greedily and enlargedly deſires an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be gracious; he waits in Heaven to be pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in Remembrance to do his People good.</p>
               <p>This way is their bleſſed Intercourſe maintained betwixt Chriſt in Heaven, and Believers on Earth, by this Chriſt hears from them on Earth, and they from him in Heaven, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 13, 14. <hi>Thou that dwelleſt in the Gardens, the Companions heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to thy Voice, cauſe me to hear it:</hi> 'Tis, in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>Cauſe to hear me,</hi> which occaſions a twofold reading. Firſt, <hi>Cauſe me to he heard,</hi> they are Chriſts Words to his Spouſe, <hi>Let me be the Subject of thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to others.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Cauſe me to hear it,</hi> that is, let me be ſpoken to, let me hear thy Voice in Prayer, as a man deſires to hear from his Wife, when abſent; and in the next <hi>verſ.</hi> She eccho's back the ſame Requeſt to Chriſt, that he would haſten his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her, that ſhe might have his Company alſo: by Prayer Chriſt and Believers have ſweet Intercourſe with each other, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7, 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus is wonderfully delighted to hear from his People, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Return, Return, O Shulamite, &amp;c.</hi> This word <hi>Shula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> comes either from <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſo her Husbands
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48427:70"/> name is named on her, or from <hi>Salem,</hi> Peace, which is <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhewing her Deſcent to be from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> above; hence Chriſt deſires her Company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was pleaſure to him to look upon her, her Countenance was as two Armies; it is in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> the ſame word that <hi>Jacob</hi> puts on the place where God met him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 1. 2. As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, thy Sight is Angelical to me, tho thou art impure in thy ſelf, yet thou art fair in mine Eye.</p>
               <p>'Tis a mighty thriving way: there's no ſuch courſe can be taken to grow rich apace in divine Treaſures; Prayer is the Key that opens Chriſt Treaſury, and fetches out the Riches of Heaven, becauſe ſuch may have of God what they will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 7. God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways giving where gracious Souls are rightly asking; God's readineſs to give ſhould be an Argument al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to crave: as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> when Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> ask'd him when he would leave off beging, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when your Majeſty leaves off giving.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Truſt to an interceding Jeſus, expect all your Mercies from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>In the Morning I will direct my Prayer to thee, and look up:</hi> the Arabick, and ſome other Verſions have it, <hi>I will prepare or ſtand before him, and he will ſee me.</hi> But this agrees not with the Original, where 'tis, <hi>I will order or diſpoſe my Prayer,</hi> as a General doth his Army, and will look out as a man that watches on a Tower, to ſee what I can eſpy and what Anſwer he will give. By a Metonomy, it ſignifies to expect or look for ſome thing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 21. <hi>In his Name ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi> The Lord Jeſus is the ſure and certain Object of a Believers Truſt; O Chriſtians! is Chriſt entred into Heaven, there to appear for his People? O then
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48427:70"/> depend upon his Interceſſion, expect all your needed Mercies by him, take up your Acquieſcence in his Mediation for you, reſt ſatisfied (Believers) that your caſe is good, and it ſhall be well with you in every Condition, becauſe Chriſt intercedeth for you. Now to ſtrengthen your Dependance on Chriſt. Conſider,</p>
               <p>His Engagement to the Father to become your Advocate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39. His Promiſe to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to purſue their Cauſe in Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16. And his full Accompliſhments with whatever is needful to compleat this Work. He is infinitely wiſe, and knows how to manage your Concerns and proſper, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. He hath Skill and Counſel to finiſh his Affairs with Diſcretion; he knows your Caſes better than your ſelves, and what Arguments to plead ſo as to prevail, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24. 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 27. 28. He is active and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and quick at Work, as well as in Wiſdom. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 3. He is ſtill unwearied in his Buſineſs, and his Spirit never fails, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 4. His Eyes are always open, he never ſlumbers or ſleeps, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121. 4. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27, 3. He loſeth no time, but takes the fitteſt Occaſion to perfect his Deſigns, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6. He is faithful in his Undertakings, and one whom you may confide, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. His name is faithful, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. He is omnipotent and powerful to fulfil his Pleaſure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. The Almighty one who can prevail with the Father, and is one with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 42. <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 30. Conſider Chriſt's Intereſt in his people, they are his own, <hi>John</hi> 13. 1. They are his Seed, Treaſure, Jewels, Members, and Sheep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 3. They are his Spouſe, and therefore he cannot forget, or neglect their Concerns, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 5. 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 7.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:48427:71"/>
               <p> Think on his Concernments in all the Affairs of his Intereſt; by vertue of that Union betwixt Chriſt and his People, he becomes a ſharer with them in all their Conditions, their Mercies are his Delight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 27. and their Afflictions are his Trouble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. He ſympathizeth with them as the head with the Members, and the Husband with the Spouſe; their loſs is his Loſs, and their Gain he reckons as his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Should Saints and their Concernments miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry at laſt, Chriſt himſelf would be a certain and eternal Looſer: he would looſe his Blood, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, his Obedience and Sufferings.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider, Chriſt's Glory conſiſts in the Good and Salvation of Believers, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 12. His Glory is wrapt up in their Glory, and his Life in their Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 10.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, acknowledge the Interceſſion of Chriſt to be the procuring Cauſe of all your Mercies; in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reception of Mercy ſee an Interceding Jeſus, and ſay Lord, 'tis thy Mediation I owe theſe Enjoyments, Priviledges, and Prayer-returns unto, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 1. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>In all thy ways acknowledge him.</hi> This is to pay Tribute to Chriſt in Heaven, and advance the Glory of the bleſſed Mediator; this is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt his Due, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. and a ſacrificing to God and not to your Dreg; as it is Chriſt in Beleliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is the Hope of Glory, ſo it is Chriſt in Heaven is the Hope and Procurer of Mercy.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If Chriſt be your Advocate in Heaven, then follow his Inſtructions on Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 5. He that commits his Cauſe to another, commits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Counſel alſo to be guided by him in every thing, that might conduce to his Succeſs in it; Chriſt's work in Heaven is to order and regulate his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48427:71"/> People on Earth, and therefore he is the Law-giver, and King as well as Saviour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 12. and the Duty of all Chriſt's Clyents on Earth, is to live by his Preſcription and Order given them; and therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 18. <hi>The Princes digged the Well, even the Nobles of the People, digged it by the Direction of the Law-giver.</hi> This is ſpoken of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Well <hi>Beer-Elim:</hi> that is, the Well of the mighty ones, that God gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs: it was alone the Gift of God, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. I will give them Waters, yet they muſt dig for it, as here; and that according to Preſcription, as <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them from the Lord: This well was a Figure of Chriſt, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themſelves, in their <hi>Midraſh Koheleth do acknowledge, as</hi> (ſay they) <hi>The firſt Redeemer cauſed a Well to ſpring up, ſo the laſt Redeemer ſhall cauſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſpring up;</hi> as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Joel</hi> 3. 18. <hi>A Fountain ſhall come forth from the Houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the Valley of Shittim;</hi> which ſignified the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, that Well of Water ſpringing up to Life eternal, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Become Advocates for Chriſt on Earth, confeſs his name. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 11. Plead his cauſe before men, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Plead with your Mother.</hi> This is ſpoken to the pious in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as <hi>Jonathas Caldaeus, Jerom,</hi> and others conceive) who are the men, and the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> their Mother, and their pious Children muſt plead, that is, expoſtulate, reaſon, and contend with her for God to bring her to the Senſe of her Sin and Danger; the Lord Jeſus underwent all dangers in owning your Cauſe, ſo ſhould you in his: he always inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for you, ſo ſhould you for him in Word and Deed; your Lives and Lips ſhould plead for him: He
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48427:72"/> pleads effectually for you, ſo ſhould you labour to be as ſucceſsful as you may for him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 29. and in order to the Diſcharge of this important Duty, conſider,</p>
               <p>That the ſuitable Qualifications of an Advocate muſt be acquired, you muſt get Wiſdom to know Chriſt and the things of his Will, Kingdom, and Glory, you are not likely to do much Service to Chriſts Intereſt, if you are ignorant and unacquainted with his Laws and Concernments, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 9, 10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17. You muſt be active and vigorous for God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. Slothful Spirits are not like to be much ſerviceable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 15. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11, 12. You muſt be faithful, and have Truth in the inner parts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 42. You muſt labour after Potency and Mightineſs through Chriſt, that you may prevail for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 22. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 13. Now the way to get this Strength for Chriſt, is by Faith to live on him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <p>You muſt make a thorough and open Profeſſion of him, and of all his Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. profeſs him at all times, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 32. profeſs him openly, plainly, ſincerely, and boldly, ſo did the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>You muſt patiently, perſevere under all Sufferings for him, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32.</p>
               <p>You muſt ſpeak well for Chriſt at all times, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>You muſt live out his Glory, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13.</p>
               <p>Thus have we done with the Applicatory part of this Point, and diſpatch'd the wonderful Riches of Chriſt, as to his perſonal Union.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Opening ſomewhat of the ſweet Diſpoſitions of Chriſt,</hi> viz. <hi>His Goodneſs, Love, and the Riches thereof, as to the kind, Fruits, and Effects of it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Am now come to the third particular, wherein we ſhall make a Diſcovery of the Riches of Chriſt, as they conſiſt in his excellent and ſweet Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as Mediator, with thoſe precious Graces and Endowments in him, which will much illuſtrate the perſonal Riches of Chriſt, and be of wonderful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement both to Saints and Sinners, to think better of him, and to haſten after a Dependance on him.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt thing we ſhall treat of, is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Nature: He is Goodneſs it ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 8. <hi>O taſt and ſee that the Lord is good:</hi> This Pſalm was penn'd by David, when he was driven from <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and was in ſore danger of his Life; in this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſeeks the Lord, and found help, by reaſon of the Goodneſs of God, that is, God in Chriſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is Creation-Goodneſs, and providential-Goodneſs, but the choiceſt is his Redemption-good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that Goodneſs which he lets out to poor Sinners in a Mediator. Thus is Jeſus Chriſt the Gift of his beſt Love, and is qualified, and diſpoſed to commend the infinite Goodneſs of God to periſhing Sinners: his Goodneſs is great, <hi>Zac.</hi> 9. 17. called the Riches of his Goodneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. Now this goodneſs of Chriſt appears.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48427:73"/>
               <p> Firſt, In it's Extenſiveneſs, he is good to all, Mans goodneſs is contracted and narrow, its greateſt Proportion reacheth but a few, none but Friends, Relations, and ſuch as may oblige or requite them, are uſually Sharers in it; but the goodneſs of Chriſt is immenſe, it reacheth to all the work of his hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 9. <hi>The Lord is good to all, by him all things conſiſt, Col.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>He upholdeth all things by the word of his Power,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. The very vileſt, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Grace-abuſing Soul have ſome kind of ſhare in Chriſts Goodneſs; he upholds his very Enemies, and maintains the Being and Enjoyment of ſuch as oppoſe him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In it's Invincibleneſs; all the Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Enemies cannot impede it's deſigned cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, he is reſolved they ſhall have a ſhare in his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, though they oppoſe their own Mercies; nay all the Unkindneſs of his people cannot conquer it, nor many Waters quench it: <hi>He maketh his Sun to ſhine upon the good and bad, Math.</hi> 5. 45. It's ſtrange to think how rare a portion of Mercy the wicked have in their day; he that cryed Father forgive them they know not what they do, cries Father ſpare them to ſee what they will be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It's Freeneſs; 'tis not extracted, but flows out of it's own Accord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 24. <hi>Before they call, I will anſwer,</hi> &amp;c. It hath no Creature-merit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it, <hi>Exek.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy Blood, live,</hi> when there was no Beauty to attract it, no deſires to draw it forth: mans Worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no ground for the Communication of Chriſts Goodneſs, what Lovelyneſs had the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it's liberal Effuſions? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48427:73"/>
               <p> Fourthly, 'tis unwearied, enduring Goodneſs, it hath not the Shallowneſs of a ſlender Veſſel, which is eaſily emptyed, but the Unfathomableneſs of the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that can never be exhauſted: the vaſt Expences and Communications of it, from the Creation of the World to it's final Deſtruction, will not diminiſh it one Iota; his Anger indeed hath but a momentary Continuance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 5. But his Goodneſs endureth for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 1.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, 'Tis Communicative goodneſs, running over, flowing down, and liberally diffuſing it ſelf for the good of others; ſo 'tis defined to be a Vertue by which a perſon of his own accord is abundantly prone to acts of Benignity: Chriſt's Goodneſs is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtative, diſtributive, and it's Diſpenſations are as natural as the irradiating Beams of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another excellent Diſpoſition in Chriſt, is his Love, not only his Phylanthropy, or good Will he bears to all men, and the Deſire he hath of their Salvation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. But his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Love, from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>valde &amp;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>acquieſco,</hi> ſuch an ardent Affection hath the heart of Chriſt, for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon adhering to him, that it greatly acquieſces in, and is fully contented with him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. Such is the Sweetneſs of Chriſt's Nature, that it is full of Love, <hi>God is Love,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 16. <hi>And as the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you,</hi> Joh. 15. 9. Now this Love of Chriſt to his people, is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A ſupreme Love, the chiefeſt Love, he hath a love of Benevolence to all, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 21. He beheld the young man and loved him; but the Love he bears his own, is tranſcendent, and exceeds the Love of men and Angels, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, An infinite Love, Love that paſſeth all
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48427:74"/> Knowledge, exceedeth all Dimenſions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18. Chiſt's Love (ſaith one) hath Length in it, becauſe he loved his Elect from Eternity to Eternity; O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable Length that hath no end! his Love hath Breadth in it, becauſe not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, are ſharers in it; 'tis extended to the whole World, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. It hath depth in it, becauſe it brought him down into the Deeps, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Earth, but of unconceivable Sufferings: It brought him as low as the Grave, yea to the very Borders of Hell, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. It hath height in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it aſcended far above all Heavens, that he might fill all in all, become our Advocate there, prepare us for it, and it for us, and at laſt takes us up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that we may behold his Glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, An eternal Love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love.</hi> All Creature-affections have their Beginning and End, their Riſings and Settings, but the Love of Chriſt is as himſelf, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. The tranſiency of his peoples Love, cannot injure its permanency, for <hi>where he loves, he loves to the end,</hi> Joh. 13. 1.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, An unchangeable Love, it hath no Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and Flowings, Waxings and Waneings, Riſings and Fallings, but is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. It knows no Alteration, Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Diminution: the Heavens ſhall wax old as a Garment, and be changed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 11. 12. But Chriſt and his Love is invariable, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6. 'Tis true, the Manifeſtations of his Love is mutable, (he may ſmile to day, and frown to morrow) but not the nature of it; the Ciſterns may be dry but not the Fountain.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A free Love, it hath no Conſideration of Creature-merit, fore-ſeen Faith, or perſevering Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48427:74"/> 
                  <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>I will heal their Back-ſlidings, and love them freely.</hi> What reaſon can be given, that of the ſame Lump ſhould be made one Veſſel of Honour, and another of Diſhonour; nay that perſons of the moſt exquiſite Abilities, natural Endowments, unſpotted Moralities, and uncontroulable Sovereignty, ſhould be rejected, and left to the hardneſs of their Heart, and the righteous Judgment of God, and that others of the meaneſt parts, inconſiderable Qualifications, prodigiouſly vitious Lives and miſerable Penury, ſhould be elected to the higheſt Priviledges, received into the moſt intimate Communion, and made partaker of the higheſt Glory?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Spring and Fountain of all that Love that is in Believers to God and one another, Creature-affections are but ſtreams deriv'd from this Ocean, Candles lighted at this Sun: <hi>We love him becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. The aſcending Love of Saints is a faint Reflection of the deſcending Love of Chriſt; the ſame Waters that empty themſelves into the Sea, have their Birth from it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, An active love, Creature-affections are dull and ſluggiſh, and ſavour rankly of the Veſſel they are in, but Chriſt's are vigorous and laborious; a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental Love, that ſets his Wiſdom on deſigning, his Faithfulneſs on ſecuring, and his Power on accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the chiefeſt Concernments, and higheſt good of his Children.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, a fruitful Love, full of good Works, 'tis commended love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. manifeſted love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 9. Not love in the Womb, or abortive, but love in the Birth: I ſhall name ſome of it's Fruits to his People.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the giving of himſelf for them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48427:75"/> 
                  <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. This is the higheſt Teſtimony of his Love imaginable, he could not have beſtowed a better thing; he that gives himſelf, gives all. He gave himſelf to procure a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Treaſure to enrich them, to deſtroy the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition Wall, and fill up that bottomleſs Gulf, that lay in their way to glory: he gave himſelf to diſcharge their Debts, remove their Guilt, juſtifie their Perſons fulfil all Righteouſneſs, and make good the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The opening of his heart to them, <hi>John</hi> 15. 14, 15. <hi>I have called you Friends, for all that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you:</hi> O! the wonderful Love and Kindneſs of Chriſt to his People, that he communicates his Secrets, and opens to them the Thoughts of his Heart from all Eternity; he leads them into his retired Chambers and ſecret Receſſes, and feaſts them liberally with hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> and excellent Diſcoveries of the things freely given them of God: Saints cannot aſcend up into Heaven, and ſee the Length Depth, Breadth and Height of thoſe glorious things God hath prepared for them, but they have the Priviledge to wade deep into ſanctuary Waters, and the Spirit of Grace is freely given them to reveal the Depths of divine Love.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Communication of all good things to them, <hi>He will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he withhold, Pſa.</hi> 84. 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 10. O boundleſs Love indeed! he may beſtow ſome ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar Portions on his Enemies, but his Children only ſhall have the Inheritance, they ſhall have his Wiſdom to direct them, his Goodneſs to ſupply them, his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to protect them, and his Spirit to inſtruct them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. 14. And O what a wonderful Gift is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48427:75"/> the Spirit; he will ſhew them their Duty, reprove them for their Sin, anſwer their Doubts, clear up their Way, and enlighten them in their Darkneſs: he will open their Hearts, enlarge their Souls, regulate their Wills, illuminate their Minds, and ſanctifie their Perſons; he will communicate Counſel, reveal Chriſt, diſcover their Inheritance, and ſeal them up to the day of Redemption.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His minding and purſuing all their Concerns in Heaven, the Buſineſs Believers have in another Country where they cannot come is very weighty; they need Receptions of more Grace eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, Strength againſt Corruption, Wiſdom in their Difficulties, Patience in their Sufferings, and Faith in their Temptations; now Chriſt doth agitate their Cauſe, becomes their Factor, and diſpatches their Work, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His gracious Preſence with them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs, Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, He may hide his face for ſometime, and ſuſpend the gracious light of his Countenance: he may ſtand behind the Wall, and ſtep behind the Curtain, yet theſe are but momentary, not continual, and imaginary, not real.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His bearing with them, and forbearing of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Charity beareth all things,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be overloaded: what groſs Indignities and abuſive Injuries doth Chriſt patiently receive from the hands of his People? <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 10.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, His thinking often and well of them, and his being a Friend to their Friends, and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their Enemies: where a mans Affections are there will his Thoughts be alſo; the Adulterers Thoughts are on his Uncleanneſs, the wordly man's
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48427:76"/> on his Treaſures, and the Ambitious on his Honours, but Chriſt's are on his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 4. They are his <hi>Hephzibah</hi>'s, the delight of his Soul, his Jewels and Treaſures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 4. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. He eſteems their Enemies as his, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 29. and favours their Friends with peculiar Bleſſings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 5.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, His being troubled with their Troubles, and delighted with their Welfare, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 33. 35, 36. when the Lord Jeſus came to raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, and ſaw <hi>Mary</hi> weeping, and the <hi>Jews</hi> that were with her, 'tis ſaid, <hi>He groaned in Spirit, and was troubled:</hi> nay when he came to the place where <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> lay, he wept; whereupon the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold how he loved him,</hi> and his Heart is the ſame now in Heaven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. True love will ſuffer in the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of it's Friend, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4. hence the Afflictions of Saints are call'd the Afflictions of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. what <hi>Heſter</hi> ſaid concerning her people, may be more truly ſpoken by Chriſt, <hi>Heſter.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>How can I endure to ſee the Evil that ſhall come upon my people.</hi> He is grieved at the Evil of their Sins or Sufferings, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. and takes wonderful Pleaſure in their Welfare, <hi>Poov.</hi> 8. 31. no tender parent can more earneſtly deſire the Happineſs, and rejoyce in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of his Children, than Jeſus Chriſt in his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 11. If the Joy of his Ambaſſadors doth much depend upon the Proſperity of the Souls of their Auditors, 3 <hi>Epiſt. Joh. ver.</hi> 4. Then ſurely himſelf is not altogether unconcern'd.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, His preparing a Heaven for them, <hi>John</hi> 14. 2, 3. <hi>In my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions, I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord Jeſus knows that his departure from the World with the ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences thereof, would breed great Trouble in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48427:76"/> Hearts of his Diſciples; therefore labours to prevent it, by telling them of the occaſion of his Departure, that it was for their ſakes, and in their buſineſs; and though the World would abuſe them when he was gone, and caſt them out of their Houſe and Country, yet he tells them, he had a Father in Heaven that would receive them, and he was going thither to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for them, and there was ſtore of room for them in Heaven. The word, tranſlated <hi>Manſion</hi> here, ſignifies, an abiding, fixed place. Here you dwell in Tabernacles, but in Heaven are places for you, out of which you ſhall never be turned more. Don't expect much Happineſs in the World, but look to Heaven for all your ſatisfying Comforts: There's a Reſt for you, after all your wearying Duties and Troubles; there are pleaſant Habitations, after all your Wilderneſs Journeyings: There's a large dwelling-place; here you are thruſt into corners, and may be have little conveniencies in your Houſes: Here you dwell in Strangers, and perhaps, Enemies Houſes, but there your dwelling ſhall be in your Father's Houſe. 'Tis really ſo, I do not flatter you with vain hopes, or feed you with falſe reports: if it were not ſo, I would have told you. Some might object here, That there may be Houſes in Heaven, and yet they in Hell. No (ſays Chriſt) I go to prepare a place for you; when I come to Heaven, I will beſpeak a Houſe for you, it ſhall be your own, your own proper Right, every one of you, and of all my People, ſhall have a Houſe of their own, and it ſhall be Fee ſimple, theirs to all Eternity. But ſome may ſay, How ſhall we be ſure of this, that when we dye we ſhall have a place in Glory? Why, ſaith Chriſt, As ſure as I go to Heaven, ſhall you have a Manſion there; for, 'tis one end of my going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; 'tis part of my buſineſs there, I go to prepare a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48427:77"/> place for you. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) This word, ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> notes a Divine Appointment, a place that God allots and appoints for you: that you might not think it is procured by your own Merit and labours. As if he ſhould ſay, you may be ſure, my People, you ſhall not miſs of a place in my Father's Houſe, becauſe he hath given you a houſe in Heaven, and I go to poſſeſs it for you, and to make it ſure: My Father hath given it, and I have purchaſed it, and now I go to take it into my own hand for you: yea, to fit and ſute your Lot in Heaven, as may be moſt meet for you, and as may bear a full proportion to all your Labours, and Sufferings for me. And thus the word likewiſe imports (ſaith Dr. <hi>Preſton)</hi> to fit and faſhion one, as a Veſſel is faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd and ſhap'd to its proper Uſe. But Believers may urge, Lord, how ſhall we get thither? the Journey is far, the Way we know not; many Dangers lye betwixt this and Heaven; the Prince of the Air, and all the Devils of Hell lye betwixt this and Glory; and how ſhall we get ſafely through all theſe Dangers? Why, ſaith Chriſt, I will come again and receive you, when I have done your Work in Heaven, when I have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched my gathering, and compleating work on Earth, when all my Saints are called and perfected, then will I come again, and receive you to my ſelf; I will come and unite your Souls and Bodies together, and then will ſhew you the way to Heaven, and lead you into your own habitations there, and as ſurely put you into poſſeſſion of Glory, as I am going to poſſeſs it for my ſelf; and in the mean time, I will take care of you in the way, and ſend my Spirit to guide you, and bear you thorow it, and my Angels, when you are at your Journeys end, ſhall receive your Souls, and bring them unto me, that where I am you may be alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 26. What greater
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48427:77"/> Love can there be than the Engagements of Chriſt's Heart, to get all his Children brought home to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that they may be ever with him, and partake of his Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22, 23.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="chapter">

               <argument>
                  <p>Several Deductions drawn from the Love of Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF the Lord Jeſus be ſo full of Love and tender Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: then,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What reaſon have Sinners never to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, till the Lord Jeſus become their Friend, till they have an Intereſt in his ſpecial Love. Alas, poor Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the common Love of Chriſt, though now you fare the better for it, will ſhortly be at an end: His Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy, though procious, yet is but like a Box of Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may be waſted and conſum'd, <hi>Mark,</hi> 14. 4. But his ſpecial Love is like the two Olive Trees, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 12. always emptying out it ſelf through the golden Pipes of his Ordinandes to his People: Chriſt's common Love to Sinners, is like a Land-flood, that will be drained: But his ſpecial Love is compar'd to a Fountain, a Wood of Water that ſpringeth up to Life Eternal. O then labour after an Intereſt in this Love of Chriſt, that brings Salvation: Put away the Evil of thy doings, hearken to Chriſt's counſel, receive him into thy Heart by Faith; obey his Voice, take him to be thy Lord and God, and thou ſhalt poſſeſs his love too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then what an abominable thing is it to hate Chriſt? how unexcuſable will Sinners Enmity againſt him be when he comes to Judgment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 5.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48427:78"/> 
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36. <hi>All they that hate me love Death, Pſal.</hi> 21. 8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 18. <hi>Nah.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>3dly, Then why ſhould Believers take up ſuch hard thoughts of Chriſt? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 27. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Jacob, my way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is paſſed over from my God?</hi> that is, my Condition, my trouble, my Soul is out of God's thoughts: He takes no notice of, nor cares what becomes of me: <hi>And my Judgment;</hi> that is, God's judging my Cauſe, his righting and helping my oppreſſed Soul, is gone from me, or he hath laid it aſide, he will not help me in my Affliction. This was <hi>Sion</hi>'s complaint, and hard thoughts of God, and this diſpleaſed him; <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Jacob,</hi> &amp;c? As if he ſhould ſay, what cauſe haſt thou, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> my People, to entertain ſuch harſh conceptions of my Love? what Iniquity haſt thou found in me? what wrong have I done thee? Have I not born thee from the Womb, and carried thee all the dayes of old? Look back to the Red Sea, and to the Wilderneſs, who cared for thee there? Call to mind the Manna, and the Rock, the Bread and Water on the Way; I ſuffered none to do thee harm, I delivered thee out of the hands of all thy Enemies, and plagued them that injured thee: Thus have I been thy help from thy Youth up, and why ſayeſt thou then, my way is hid from the Lord? O <hi>Jacob,</hi> thou doſt ill to cenſure me ſo ſeverely; Is this the requital of all my love and kindneſs to thee hitherto? Repent of theſe injurious apprehenſions, and put more favourable conſtructions on my wayes; Gracious Souls have no reaſon to prejudge the Heart of Chriſt, and cenſure him of unkindneſs and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: for 'tis impoſſible he ſhould forget his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 15. He hath paid too dear for them to do ſo: They have coſt his Blood, Eternal Counſels, many Troubles, many Wonders, and will he reject them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48427:78"/> all? O no. He hath engraven them on the Palms of his hands, where he cannot but ſee, and muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their names, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 16. I cannot look upon my hands, but I muſt remember thee: I ſhould forget my ſelf, ſhould I forget thee: thou art ſet as a Seal upon my Heart, and thy Walls are continually before me: that is, though thy Protection be gone for a time, and I have left thee to the Will of thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet I will redeem and ſecure thee, I will raiſe up thy Walls, and re-eſtabliſh thy State, for thy Walls are before me, though thou ſeeſt them not, I can and will preſerve them; thou art Weak, but I am ſtrong, I faint not though thou fainteſt, I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver weary though thou art tyred, and as ſure as I have Strength, I will give it thee; they that wait on the Lord ſhall renew their Strength, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 28. Again, you cannot ſee the way to get out of your Troubles, your Wiſdom is non-pluſt, but mine is not ſo; <hi>There is no ſearching of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> O then do not give up thy Hopes O <hi>Jacob,</hi> or conclude I have forgotten thee: He hath promiſed he will not caſt off his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor leave them comfortleſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>And he is not as a man that he ſhould lye,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 19. He hath given them his Seal to it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. Nothing can ſeparate his love from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. 38, 39.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But I am afraid I am none of Chriſts, nor have the Spirit, becauſe of the Filthineſs, Obdurateneſs, and Irregularity of my Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> If ever thou hadſt the Spirit, thou haſt it ſtill, <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. Gracious Souls may ſometimes ſeem to themſelves to be carnal, and ſold under Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. They may not ſee any good thing dwell in them, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. but be like to the ſlain
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48427:79"/> that lye in the Grave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 5. So <hi>Heman</hi> thought himſelf one free among the dead, whom the Lord would remember no more: in the Winter there's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle viſible difference between the living and the dead Tree; neither is there betwixt a Saint and a Sinner in time of Deſertion and Temptation: God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be led captive by Sin, and brought into Bondage by their Luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. and then 'tis hard to ſay, how unlike they are to them that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew God; and therefore Chriſtian judge not thy ſelf by thy changeable Frames, if thou doſt not repent of thy Change, thy leaving thy old Courſes and chuſing God and Grace, a <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. 10. If thou doſt not approve of any Sin, or ſecretly love thy filthy ways, <hi>Romans</hi> 7. 15. 20. If thy Heart be diſcontented with thy ſtate of back-ſliding, and longeth after a return to thy reſting place, then thou art gracious, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 7. If thou doſt find a War betwixt thy Members and thy Mind, the Law of the Spirit of Life warring againſt the Law of Sin and Death, thy ſtate is good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21, 22 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>The Pleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) The word notes a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and continued Deſire, a Deſire which is ſtill in Action, and working till we have it accompliſht, not a ſudden Motion or momentary Paſſion. Look how Corruption and Luſt works againſt Grace, ſo doth Grace againſt Corruption, <hi>for theſe two are contrary,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the one lays Seige againſt the other, as a Souldier in a Trench againſt a Fort. Now if it be ſo with thy Soul, that thou findeſt in it two parties, as Twins in the Womb oppoſing each other, and doſt experience ſomething in thy Will againſt Sin, as well
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48427:79"/> as for it, and ſomething in thy Affections, an Enemy to thy Corruptions as well as a Friend; if thou long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as much for Freedom from Sin as from Hell, and thy Heart cannot be at peace whilſt the Body of Sin remains in thee, then lift up thy head, O Soul, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be brought forth to Victory, and the top ſtone ſhall in due time be laid with ſhouting, Grace, Grace! to it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then you that are Chriſt's, take heed you abuſe not his Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>What then? Shall we ſin becauſe we are not under the Law but under Grace? God forbid.</hi> That is, ſhall we yield our Souls to the Service of Sin, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. or give a willing Conſent to the Commiſſion of it? God forbid; That is, far be it from us, noting it to be a vile and abominable thing, to Sin under Grace, and againſt Grace; this is a moſt diſingenuous thing to abuſe love, and requite Evil for Good: it is moſt unjuſt to injure him that loveth you, 'tis a coſtly Sin, and will have a bitter reckoning at laſt, 'tis a Spot notoriouſly like the Spot of Reprobation, <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 4. But if it may conſiſt with Grace, yet it will break your Bones, and ſcourge you ſoundly e're God hath done; what did <hi>David, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> get by abuſing divine Love?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Admire Chriſt's love, his love is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſing Knowledge, you uſe to admire things that are ſtrange, and beyond your reach, but what more miraculous and unparellel'd than this, That the Lord of Glory who hath Angels at his Service, ſhould ſet his Affections on poor polluted Duſt and Aſhes, on Fleas and Worms, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves to be, that ſo illuſtrious a perſon as the Lord Jeſus ſhould fall in love with ſo deformed a piece as man, in whom was neither Beauty nor
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48427:80"/> Riches, Vertue nor Honour, and be enamoured of him ſo greatly, as to take him into his Boſom, and a conjugal Relation with himſelf; 'tis ſo ſtupendious a Miracle, that 'tis ſaid, he ſhall be admired of all that believe when he comes, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians gather in all your Valuations from Creatures, for your Creator and Redeemer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 1.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Adventure on the Love of Chriſt, ſwim on theſe deep Waters, roll your ſelves on theſe divine Depths, and confide in his new Covenant love, for 'tis unchangeable love to the end; many waters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quench it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 7. Truſt his Love (I ſay) in the way of Obedience, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21. 23. If his love be free, then 'tis not for your ſake, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 17. Not for your Beauty or Holineſs, but for his own good Pleaſure, <hi>Of his own Will begat he us,</hi> Jam. 1. 18. He loves you Believers, becauſe you are his own, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1. And becauſe it hath pleaſed him to make you his people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. If he loves thoſe that love him, then ſurely he will kindly reſent the Arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thy Affections to him; O adventure on this Love.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The glorious Excellency of Chriſt's tender Pity opened and diſplayed in the ſeveral Acts of it, both to Saints and Sinners.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANother Diſcovery of the Sweetneſs of Chriſt's Diſpoſition is,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Pity, this is lookt upon as an excellent Qualification, and that which renders a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lovely among men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>For ſcarcely for a righteous man will one dye, yet peradventure for a good man ſome would even dare to dye:</hi> for a juſt man, one that is ſtrict and rigid in his Life and matters of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, none will dye; but for a good man, that is, for a bountiful, liberal man, for a Benefactor (ſaith <hi>Beza)</hi> for a Friend (ſaith another) ſome would even dare to dye; Kindneſs and Compaſſion renders men lovely and amiable in the Sight of Heathens: hence one calls a merciful man a precious thing, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes him equal to God, God himſelf prefers Mercy above Sacrifice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13. This the Lord opened to <hi>Moſes</hi> as part of his Glory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>The Lord God merciful and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. And this mercifulneſs is placed in the Nature of Chriſt, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and therefore muſt needs render him glorious,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48427:81"/> and be part of his unſearchable Riches: now that the Lord Jeſus is ſo full of Pity and Mercy in his very Nature, the Scripture is clear. This was one Qualification neceſſary to his Prieſt-hood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. This was a ſpecial Requiſite to the Prieſt under the Law, that he ſhould be one who might have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the Ignorant, and them that are out of the way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 2. Therefore the high-prieſt muſt be a Man, not an Angel, that ſo he being ſubject to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, to Sins, and Weakneſſes himſelf, he might the better have Compaſſion upon others in the like eaſe. The ſame Argument the Lord uſeth to <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Love ye therefore the Stranger, for ye were Strangers in the Land of</hi> Aegypt. Experience of Affliction fits a perſon for pity to others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our Lord took our Nature upon him, that being compaſt with the ſame Infirmities (Sin only excepted) he might be able to have Compaſſion on others: this is neceſſary in that Office, for a perſon will never be active in ſuch laborious work for Sinners, as offering of Gifts and Sacrifices for Sin, if he have not tender Bowels towards perſons in Miſery: and therefore Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs be ſuch a one, who can have Compaſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The word is ſignificant, 'tis in the Original (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to have Compaſſion on others according to the Meaſure and Proportion of their Miſery: <hi>Paraeus</hi> renders it, to have Compaſſion as much as is needful; <hi>Beza,</hi> to be affected according to the greatneſs of anothers Miſery, and ſuch is the Compaſſion of Chriſt, 'tis ſuted to the Condition of his People: were Chriſt's Pity but one Grain ſhort of the Miſery and Condition of Sinners, he could never ſave them to the utmoſt; for if he will ſave to the uttermoſt, he muſt ever live to make Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48427:81"/> there's no one moment of time, in which they don't want help, and muſt have Gifts offer'd for them: But this Chriſt will not do, if he wants Compaſſion, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 11. The Lord is ſaid <hi>to be pitiful, and of tender mercies</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) of many Bowels; or, as <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, multum viſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ralis;</hi> much bowelful, all pitiful, from inward deep Bowels (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) The word is to pity with the Bowels of a Mother, to be prone to compaſſion: So <hi>Aeſtius; He is rich in mercy,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. Great in Quantity, and Choice in Quality, great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and choice Mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>According to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy tender mercies.</hi> The word <hi>Rab,</hi> multitude, ſignifies Quality as well as Quantity: many Mercies, or weighty Mercies: Mercies; <hi>Rachamim:</hi> 'Tis ſuch love and pity as Mothers bear to the fruit of their Womb, which is fervent and flaming. The word hath no ſingular number, becauſe there are many works of Mercy, ſaith <hi>Piſcator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Compaſſion of Chriſt lies in theſe two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In his ſympathizing with his Creatures.</item>
                  <item>2. In ſupplying and ſupporting them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Pity hath ſympathy in it: an inward Heart-affecting ſenſe of another's Evils, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13. <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his children, ſo the Lord pitietb them that fear him,</hi> Judg. 10. 16. <hi>His Soul was grieved for the Children of Iſrael.</hi> The word ſignifieth, His Soul was ſhort'ned, or contracted in him, by reaſon of grief. 'Tis ſpoken by an <hi>Anthropopathy,</hi> according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of men: As a man is filled with grief, his Breaſt is ſtraitned, that he can ſcarcely breathe; It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes how much the Lord Jeſus is affected with the miſeries of his People, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. He is ſaid to be touched with the Fellow-feeling of our Infirmities, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſuffering with us. Chriſt, in Heaven, hath
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48427:82"/> ſuch a fellow-feeling of the Evils of his People, as that he reſents their troubles as his own. He is tender-hearted, and every miſery of theirs reacheth his Soul. But this hath been ſomewhat treated of before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Readineſs to ſupply, and ſupport others in their Miſery; and this is eminently manifeſted in the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 20. <hi>The Lord was ready to ſave me.</hi> Men ſometimes have a hand, but no heart; they may help, but will not; they only ſay, Go and be fed, and be cloath'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others have a heart, but no hand; they have not to ſupply the needs of others; their Cruſe of Oyl, and Barrel of Meal will reach but a little way: beſides, there may be ſome Caſes in which Men or Angels cannot help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 4. <hi>I looked on my right hand, and behold, there was no man would know me,</hi> &amp;c. But there can be no Condition in which Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency fails to help, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 27. And Chriſt is as really willing as able to ſave: He is an inexhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fountain of all good. <hi>Sufficit omnibus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus) nec ſufficit tantum, ſed dat liberaliſſime. Dives eſt</hi> (ſaith the ſame Author) <hi>ſufficientia &amp; affectu:</hi> He is good, and doth good: He feeds, gathers, carries, leads, his poor infirm Flocks, when they moſt ſtand in need of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 11. When they are ready to faint for want, he opens a Well, and fills their Bottles: when they wander from their reſting-place, he ſends his Dogs, and gathers them to his Fold; when they are weary, and can go no further, he takes them into his Arms and carries them: when they are hungry, he feeds them, when they are naked, he cloaths them: when they are ſick, he viſits them, when they are in Priſon, he comes to them: He giveth to his People richly all things to enjoy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. He exhibits, or yields out, all things, (not ſome things only) and that richly too: plentifully, not in Title only, but in Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48427:82"/> alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. He giveth Grace to help in time of need: He ſends them ſeaſonable help, help in fit time: (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) This word ſignifies, to run at ones call, to help him aſſoon as he cries for help; to run in to his Succour; ſo doth Chriſt. He is a preſent help in time of need, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 1. When they can hold out no longer, he will relieve their Siege; when they are ready to periſh, he will ſtep in betwixt them and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. And this he doth too from a tender heart, that feels, and ſhares in their Dangers. Poor Believer! let thy Condition be never ſo bad, the Lord Jeſus hath an open heart and hand for thy help. It may be, men may harden their hearts againſt thee, good men may take little notice of thee, Prieſt and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite paſs thee by, and will not know thy Soul in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; but yet comfort thy heart, thou haſt a Friend in Heaven, that grieves with, and for thee, and will open Treaſures to ſupply thee.</p>
               <p>Now this pitiful Nature of Chriſt appears in divers particulars, both to Saints and Sinners. To Saints.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In looking after their Concerns, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 22. 'Tis ſaid, that God looked upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and had reſpect unto them. This is an act of pity to look after the welfare of another. Merciful <hi>Jeſse,</hi> when his Sons were in danger, ſent <hi>David</hi> to look after them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 18. So is the heart of Chriſt concern'd in the welfare of his People, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12. The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his Ears are open to their Prayer: He knows their Souls in Adverſity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders their Troubles, and looks after their Matters, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. The want of this looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Perſons welfare, is an evidence of the want of pity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Who ſhall have pity upon thee, O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, &amp;c?</hi> O, what comfort is this to poor afflicted Souls, that though men look not after them, Friends
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48427:83"/> matter not what become of them, yet the Lord ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for them.</p>
               <p>Secondl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, In labouring to prevent their Evils. This is another act of pity, as we may ſee in <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Eſther.</hi> A dreadful Danger was near to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree paſſed by the King to cut them all off in one day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When <hi>Mordecai</hi> heard of this, how induſtriouſly doth he labour with <hi>Eſther,</hi> to improve all her Intereſt in the King to prevent it, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4. 8, 13, 14. Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not foreſee any Dangers impending on his People, but his Bowels ſtir him up to employ his Omnipotency to remove them. And this he doth,</p>
               <p>Firſt, By warning them of their Danger. He ſends them alarms, and gives them notice, as a Watchman, when their Enemies are near, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>Noah being warned of God,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Joſeph, Matth.</hi> 2. 13. was warned of God in a dream to flee into <hi>Egypt,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt was in danger of <hi>Herod</hi>'s bloody butcheries. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>Turn you, turn you from your wicked wayes, for why will you dye, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By keeping their hearts from cloſing with Temptations, when they are like to prove dangerous: So he dealt with <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 39. 9. Perhaps he may permit their falling into ſome leſſer Evils, to try, and humble them; but when the Sin will probably occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a great diſhonour to God, and endanger the final eſtate of their Souls, then uſually he will give forth preventing Grace to direct their hearts from cloſing with it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By plucking them back, when on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of deſtruction. Thus <hi>David</hi>'s feet had well nigh ſlipt, and he was almoſt gone; and then He opens a paſſage for him into the Sanctuary, and graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles to him his ſeemingly contradictory Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 2, 3, 17. And <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48427:83"/> when by lingring in <hi>Sodom,</hi> he had almoſt expos'd himſelf a prey to devouring Flames, the Angels ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly pluckt him out, and kept him from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ruine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 10, 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By ſore Afflictions, ſmarting rods, and croſs Providences, he ſometimes prevents their ſins, and ſo their deſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy word.</hi> Thus the Waters of <hi>Marah</hi> have ſometimes led to the Waters of the Sanctuary; and grievous Diſtempers on the Body have proved the health of the Soul. I have read of one, that by breaking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Leg ſaved his Life.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, By breaking the Snare when they are in it, and ſo making a way for their eſcape, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124. 7. The ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was compaſs'd round by <hi>Saul,</hi> and no poſſible way was left him to avoid the Jaws of ruine, then the Lord ſent in the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> to call off <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 24, 25, 26, 27. So, when the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> were almoſt ſtarv'd with Famine, and reduc'd to that extremity that all hopes of Safety, in man's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment failed them, then was God's time to come in to their reſcue, by ſending in Ambaſſadours to call off the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> to be King of <hi>Poland,</hi> by which means the Siege was remov'd, and upon the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Ambaſſadours, the Proteſtants obtained Liberty. Thus he ſaved <hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo, when <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Knife was at his Throat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, By giving them a Vomit, when the Poyſon is taken in, that ſo it may be timely ejected, before the danger be unremoveable. This way God prevented <hi>David</hi>'s ruine, in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> after he had fallen into the ſin, by giving him Repentance to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48427:84"/>
               <p> Thirdly, Another act of his pity is, His being ſoon affected with the Evils of his People, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of mine eye. His Soul was grieved for the miſery of Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 10. 6. He pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the poor Leper in diſtreſs, <hi>Mark,</hi> 1. 41. and was mov'd with compaſſion becauſe the Jews were as ſheep without a ſhepherd, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 34.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His viſiting them in their diſtreſſes: this is an act of love and pity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 36. <hi>I have been ſick, and ye viſited me,</hi> Joh. 14. 18. Joh. 20. 19. Exod. 3. 8. A merciful nature will ſhew it ſelf in viſiting ſuch as are afflicted; If others be ſick they will go ſee them, and condole with them: they will go rather to the houſe of mourning, than to the houſe of feaſting, <hi>Ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 7. 2. They are companions of the diſtreſſed: and ſuch is the tenderneſs of Chriſt's heart, that he chuſeth the company of the miſerable: If his People be in the Water, and in the Fire, he will be with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 2. If they be caſt out of the Synagogues, perſecuted, and deſerted for his ſake, he will find them out, and keep them company, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 35. If they be caſt on ſick beds, he will ſit by them; if they cannot ſleep through trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he will ſit up with them; when they are ſolitary and dejected, he will come and ſee them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His comforting them in their Troubles: He is the Father of Mercies, and God of all Comfort, who comforteth us in all our Tribulations. Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is an act of pity to thoſe that are in trouble, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. So <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, when they had heard of all the Evil that was come upon him, they came eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one from his place to mourn with him, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him. Herein lies much of Chriſt's pity to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he would not have them ſwallowed up of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much grief, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. When they are caſt down, he charges his Meſſengers to ſpeak comfortably to them,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48427:84"/> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 2. When he brings his People into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, he will ſpeak comfortably to them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 57. 18. This is part of Chriſt's Interceſſion in Heaven, that the Father would ſend the Comforter to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16. And part of his laſt counſel that he left with them, was, That they would be of good cheer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 1. He began his Sermon with a Uſe of Comfort, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, &amp;c.</hi> and here he cloſeth the ſame with a word of Comfort. And indeed, the whole of Chriſt's Fare-wel Sermon, was Conſolation to his People: He would not have them be in Heavineſs longer than need did require, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. but commands them to rejoyce evermore, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His counſelling them in all caſes, wherein they ſtand in need of his Advice: Hence they have Line upon line, and Precept upon Precept, that they might be wiſe to Salvation; and therefore he is called the wonderful Counſellor, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>I bleſs the Lord, who hath given me counſel. Counſel</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth) about my Sufferings, and the Glory that ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> Job 36. 8, 9, 10. Adverſity ſometimes is God's Univerſity; and, <hi>Schola Crucis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther)</hi> is <hi>Schola Lucis:</hi> Myſterious Truths many times ſpring out of Affliction-depths.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, His giving to them, and forgiving of them. Pity hath open hands, and ſtretcht out arms. Chriſt hath left a large witneſs of his liberality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Who giveth richly all things to enjoy.</hi> Men give ſparingly, but Chriſt bountifully; they with ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hearts, but he with open bowels; they ſometimes in Reverſion, but he in poſſeſſion. And he doth not only give, but forgive, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardons iniquities,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 5. <hi>Thou Lord art good, and ready to forgive,</hi> Numb. 14. 20.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48427:85"/> 1 Joh. 2. 1. They run into debt, and he diſchargeth them: They do, as it were, write down their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and he blots them out. Now, Are not theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable demonſtrations of his Pity, and affectionate compaſſions of his tender Bowels towards his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
               <p>Secondly, He hath infinite Pity for his Enemies; Mercy and good will for Sinners, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 35. This appears,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his bearing with them, and forbearing of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction:</hi> How doth the Lord ſuffer the vileſt of men to live, and that very long? <hi>Lo, I have come theſe three years looking for fruit,</hi> Luke 13. 17. <hi>Theſe forty years have I been grieved with this People,</hi> Pſal. 95. 10. An hundred and twenty years did he bear with that high and uncurable wickedneſs of the firſt World, and that after it was come to the full, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. Four hundred years did God bear with the ſins of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> even after he had given <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> their Land, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13, 16. How long did the Lord bear with the Ten Tribes after their Apoſtaſie from his pure Service? even the ſpace of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years; in which time there were Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Kings, and all wicked men, walking in the ſteps of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> O! the ſlowneſs of God to Anger, even againſt his Enemies, that dare him to his very Face, yea, that trample his Glory under foot, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, yea hour; and yet God ſpares them to old Age many times. Alas! how ſoon are we angry at our Enemies, and if but ſlighted a little, ready with the Diſciples to call for Fire from Heaven, to conſume thoſe that receive us not, <hi>Luke,</hi> 9. 54. But the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is not ſo, he waiteth that he may be gracious, and his long-ſuffering leadeth to Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:48427:85"/>
               <p> Secondly, His maintaining of them, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the higheſt rate, giving them Honour and Riches, Proſperity and Favour. <hi>Pharoah</hi> muſt have a Kingdom, and yet an Enemy to his People: <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> an Empire; <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> an hundred twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſeven Provinces; <hi>Croeſus</hi> vaſt riches, and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus</hi> delicate Pleaſures. All the Creatures are preſſed at their Service; the Air, Earth, and Sea are ranſack't to ſatiate their Luſts, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 2, 3, 4. He feeds and cloaths, helps and proſpers his greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all to heap up Coals of Fire upon their heads.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His affectionate ſeeking their Salvation. This was his Errand into the World, he came to ſave Sinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. Loſt Sinners, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 11. Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sinners, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. Blind Idolaters, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23. Cruel Perſecutors, <hi>Acts,</hi> 9. 4. Wicked Sorcerers, <hi>Acts,</hi> 8. 9. Theſe the Lord Jeſus ſeeks to ſave; he ſends his Goſpel, to invite them to come unto him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. Yea, beſeeches them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. Makes large promiſes to them, if they will return, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. Yea, how doth the Spirit ſtrive with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that they may be ſaved; Reaſons with them, <hi>Why will you dye? Come, let us reaſon together,</hi> Iſa. 1. 18. <hi>Why wilt thou not ſuffer me to ſave thy Soul, and to make thee happy to all Eternity? Poor Sinner! I have a real mind to do thee good, an affectionate kindneſs for thee; I came from Heaven to ſave ſuch as thee. Behold my hands and my feet, ſee how my heart bleeds for thee: Behold, how ready my purchaſe is; yonder is thy fair Eſtate, if thou wilt be mine. Lift up thine eyes to thoſe Manſions, Crowns and Thrones; all theſe ſhall then be thine: See thoſe beautiful Garments, conſent to me, and thou ſhalt wear thy filthy Rags, or lye in thoſe pinching ſtraits no longer; thou ſhalt lodge no more in thoſe ſtinking Kennels of thy</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:48427:86"/> 
                  <hi>Luſts: O poor Sinner! why wilt thou ſtand in thy own light, and ſlight this offer, which thou mayeſt never have made thee more? Lo, how my Bowels move towards thee, ſee how my Arms are open'd to thee; Be mine, and I will be thine; My Kingdom ſhall be thine, my Friends will be thine, my Servants ſhall be thine: My Angels ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect thee, yea, attend thee; my Creatures ſhall maintain thee, my Wiſdom ſhall guide thee, my Faithfulneſs ſhall keep thee, my Power ſhall be laid out for thee, my Love ſhall delight thee, my Honour ſhall adorn thee, and my Treaſure ſhall enrich thee: I will be a loving Husband to thee, I will provide all good things for thee; I will rejoyce over thee, I will forget the wrongs thou haſt done me; I will requite thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkindneſs with Kindneſs, and draw thee with cords of Love: with cords</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>woven and ſpun out of my very Heart and Bowels. O miſerable Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff! embrace my Counſels, liſten thine Ears to Heaven gate, and hear the melodious Muſick that is there made by refined Spirits; why, wilt thou rather lye with damned howling Devils, than ſing Hallelujah's, and the Song of the Lamb with ſaved Souls? Accept of me, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Glory, unſpeakable Priviledges, and Rivers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhall be thine.</hi> Thus doth the Lord Jeſus woo poor periſhing Souls to be happy: and is not this Pity indeed?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His readineſs to receive them when they come to him: No ſooner do they open the door but he comes in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>If any man open the door, I will come in unto him.</hi> No ſooner doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal return, but his Father meets him; yea, runs to meet him, as if he could never come ſoon enough at him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15, 20. Mercy is upon the wing, when it comes to receive returning Sinners. No ſooner did <hi>Ephraim</hi> repent, but God repented too; As ſoon as he ſaid, <hi>Turn thou me,</hi> God ſaid, He ſhall be turned;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48427:86"/> when he cries, <hi>Thou art the Lord my God,</hi> preſently God Anſwers, <hi>Is he not a pleaſant Child?</hi> So willing is Chriſt to receive returning Sinners, as that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth he will in no wiſe caſt them out, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. Yea, if they cannot come unto him, he will go and fetch them, and if they cannot go, he will draw them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His great Joy when he hath obtain'd them; The Father of the Prodigal keeps a Feaſt, and makes merry when his loſt Child is found, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 23, 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 31. The Lord ſhall rejoyce in his Works, and this he doth when he hath finiſhed them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 4. But there is nothing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt takes more pleaſure in, than in the Redemption of Souls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 31. He delighted in the habitable parts of the Earth. This you vvill find further amplified in the Parables of the loſt ſheep, and loſt piece of Silver, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. to 11.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ARE there ſuch deep, and large Bowels of Pity in Jeſus Chriſt, not only towards his Friends, but his very Enemies? Then here is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Terrour to Impenitent Sinners. Ah, Souls! hovv fearfully great is your Sin, being a plain defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Mercy and pity of Chriſt: Every Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of yours is a kicking the very Bovvels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and a ſtab at the Heart of Divine Pity: O! hovv vile are your Iniquities, vvhilſt vvithout Chriſt! They are no leſs than a deſpiſing of the Riches of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48427:87"/> and Goodneſs of God, which would have led you to Repentance, and a treaſuring up of Wrath againſt the day of Wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. O Sinners! you run on ſcore in abuſing of the higheſt Mercy that ever was, you provoke your beſt Friend againſt you: Alas! Who can help you if Mercy it ſelf becomes your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? The Bowels of Chriſt are your laſt <hi>Aſylum,</hi> if this door be ſhut againſt you, <hi>Farewel Souls;</hi> and can you hope that Mercy will plead for you, when rejected by you, or will not God hear the Complaint of deſpiſed Mercy think you? Sinners, the Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt ſhall come forth at the laſt day, and ſay, I would have ſaved that Soul, but it would not, how often would I have gathered it, but it reſiſted? <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. I offered to pay it's Debts, and to get him an Acquittance in the Court of Heaven, but he refuſed it; I would have ranſom'd him from Death to Life, and adopted him to an Inheritance in Glory, but he would not; I would have ſtamp'd the divine Nature on him, and brought him into the Likeneſs of the Lord of Glory, but he would not; I would have put down his Name in the book of Life, and ſecur'd his Title to Heaven, but he would not; I called, he would not anſwer; I perſwaded, he refuſed; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched, he deſpiſed, I ſtrived, he reſiſted; and now Juſtice, into thy hands do I deliver theſe rebellious Souls, to be dealt with according to the Threatnings of the Goſpel and Severity of the Law, that my Wrongs may be avenged.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48427:87"/> what a ſtock of Mercy is in him, for troubled Souls to trade upon, what unfathomed Deeps are there in divine Compaſſions, enough to ſerve all thy Turns and Neceſſities; have thy Sins been many? <hi>The free Gift is of many Offences to Juſtification, Rom.</hi> 5. 6. Of the Offences of many perſons, be they never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or the many Offences of one perſon, there is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue enough in this free Gift of the Blood of Chriſt for the pardoning them all, if ſuch return: he (ſaith one) that had love enough to give us Chriſt, hath Bowels enough to give us pardon: believing Souls ſhall never dye for Debt, if the Bowels of Chriſt hath wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to pay it; O! what Shifts will tender Parents make to keep their indebted Children out of Priſon? They will beg and borrow of others, pinch themſelves, and ſpare what they can, rather than their Children ſhall be undone: and ſurely the Mercy of Chriſt muſt needs make the moſt of his Blood and Obedience, of his Interceſſion and Satisfaction, for the Pardon of his People. And therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> joyns Mercies and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs together, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 9. Is thy Unworthineſs great, and deſerveſt thou nothing but Wrath from God, O bear up thy Sinking Spirit on the Arm of Mercy, Mercy is in vain, and ſignifies nothing, if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice only muſt take place: haſt thou abuſed Mercy and ſinn'd away the Favour of thy God? Thou haſt loſt his Gift, but he hath not loſt his giving, the Child ſpils his Water and goes to the Well to fill his Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er again: there is more Mercy (O troubled Soul) in the deep Wells of Salvation, for thoſe that ſeek it. <hi>Obj.</hi> But I have provoked God to withhold Mercy. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Let me tell thee, O diſtreſſed Believer, there are For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings as well as Givings in the Bowels of Chriſt, and I know not which are greater: Are thy Wants many? Be of good chear, Mercy hath enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48427:88"/> them all, and is as free to give as able, and take this for they Encouragement: Mercy never gives where there are Deſervings.

Firſt, to periſhing Sinners; make uſe of the Mercy of Chriſt whilſt you have it; now is the acceptable time, the day of Grace, the Seaſon of Viſitation; now the Sun ſhines not only in <hi>Sion</hi> but on <hi>Sodom;</hi> nay it hath ſtood ſtill on your <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon</hi> for a Seaſon, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 12. 13. O let not Mercy go, and leave you in your blood, and let you lye in your Graves; let not the Sun of the Goſpel ſet on you, and leave you in inner Darkneſs, leſt outer Darkneſs ſhortly ſeize upon you: believe it, Mercy ſeems to be near a Departure, it looks as it were, about to change Houſes, to go from <hi>Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Jews,</hi> from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> it ſeems near ſetting in <hi>England,</hi> in theſe <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> parts of the World. Who knows how ſoon it may ariſe in the <hi>Eaſt?</hi> O Sinners, don't you lye a bed in your Security, and let Mercy give you the ſlip. O then you that are yet in your blood, under Wrath, in Danger of Judgment; be adviſed to ſtrike in with Mercy, while 'tis to be had, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 6. while divine Bowels yearn towards you, weep over you, and wait for you, O turn in, and cloſe with Mercy, whiles it's face is unveil'd to you, it's Arms open'd to you, and before it hath breath'd it's laſt Breath to you; believe the Warnings and Treatnings of Mercy, bow and ſtoop to the Convictions of Mercy, receive the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof, obey it's Counſel, and perſevere it it's

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to all Souls, both changed and unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the Lord Jeſus be ſo pityful to you, O then be not cruel to your own Souls, do not rob, cheat, and cozen your own Souls, deprive them not of your own Mercies, <hi>Jonah.</hi> 2. 8. Don't conſent to thoſe ways that will rob you of all the Poſſibilities and Hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; O! the ſweet Comforts and Pleaſures that now you looſe for a few dirty Delights, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17. Think on the Subſtance, the tryed Gold, the rich Attire that you deprive your Souls of by refuſing to hearken to the Counſel of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. Don't ſtarve your Souls by feeding on Husks, while the bread of Life lies before you, this is Cruelty to them indeed, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 16. 17. Do not wound, rend, and tare your Souls by cruel Luſts: he that ſins hateth his own Soul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 32. <hi>chap.</hi> 29. 24. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 26. O the ſad Bruiſes that Sin gives, and the deſperate Gaſhes it makes in the Sinners own Soul; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36. Every Sin of thine (O carnal wretch) is a deadly blow on thy own Soul: all thy carnal Pleaſures, thy merry jeſting Words, thy Swearing, Lying, Cheating, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, and Covetouſneſs gives new Stabs to thy Heart; it would be a barbarous ſight to behold one unmercifully wounding another, much more to ſee a perſon torturing his own Soul; do not ſell thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul for a Lie, for that which is not, which will not profit in the day of Wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 19. Thus <hi>Elijah</hi> told <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 20. That he ſold himſelf to work Wickedneſs, that is, he gave
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48427:89"/> himſelf wholly to the Service of Sin, as a Servant that binds himſelf over to anothers Buſineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To the Children of Mercy, whom the Lord Jeſus hath loved and waſhed in his own Blood: you that are choſen, called, juſtified, ſanctified and adopted unto Glory, be exhorted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, be not hard-hearted to Chriſt, requite not his Pity with Cruelty, grieve not his Spirit, ſadden not his Heart with your ſinful and unſutable Walkings before him: no Sins make greater Wounds on the Heart of Chriſt, than the Sins of his own Children, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. O be not cruel to him who is ſo tender of you, do not feed him with Wormwood and Gall who hath feaſted you with Joy and Gladneſs, yea with his own Heart blood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Put on Bowels of Pity towards others, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. They that are cruel to others, ſhall find God cruel to them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13.</p>

               <p> Fourthly, His Humility and Lowlineſs of mind, This is an excellent Vertue, and that which the very Heathens have eſteemed at a high Rate: 'tis a rare thing (ſaith <hi>Aretius)</hi> and rare things are excellent: <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> calls it the chiefeſt Vertue, the Salt that ſeaſons all other Excellencies, and the Beginning of all Good.

I ſpeak not here of his divine Nature as God, though in that reſpect he is lowly too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15.

He did, as it were, evacuate himſelf, and ſpoil himſelf of all his Glory as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies; not that he ceaſed to be God, or to be equal with the Father, but he concealed all this Glory, and as it were, depriv'd himſelf of all the Manifeſtations of it, by uniting to himſelf the form of a Servant, that is, the humane nature in a ſervile State: he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Form of a Servant, <hi>Non dimittendo quod erat, ſed aſſumendo quod non erat</hi> (ſays <hi>Zanchy)</hi> As God he was omnipotent, but this Omnipotency was hid under the weakneſs of his humane Nature, his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience veiled under a limitted Knowledge, his Glory clouded under Shame, his Riches concealed under Poverty, his Majeſty obſcured under Contempt, and his Immortality cloathed with Mortality. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What Servant did Chriſt take on him the Form of? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Why: 1. Of the Servant of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold.</hi> Some take it paſſively, on whom I will lean, and in whom I will truſt, and commit my whole Work unto: others actively, whom I will raiſe up and ſtrengthen, and carry through my Work. Again, 2. He became the Servant of man alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>The Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, In his being made under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>When the Fulneſs of time was come God ſent forth his Son made under the Law,</hi> and therefore 'tis ſaid, he was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion: O! What Humility was this? That the Son of God ſhould ſtoop to the Paedagoge of the Law, and enter on this low and legal Obedience.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In his Obedience to his Parents, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their low and mean Condition, both for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48427:91"/> Food and Apparel, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 51. <hi>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was ſubject to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, In his Employment, and Calling he was pleaſed to uſe, till he entred upon his Miniſtry: He continued with his Father, and (as one of the Fathers hath it) wrought at his Father's Trade, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was called the Carpenter, <hi>Mark,</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Joſeph</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Lightfoot)</hi> taught Chriſt his own Trade: And <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (an ancient Writer) ſayes, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt, before he entred upon his Miniſtry, made Plows and Yokes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, In his Company: He did not chuſe the Society of Great and Noble, but of mean and obſcure Perſons: He ſet apart Fiſhermen and Publicans to be his Diſciples, and accompanied Publicans and Sinners, which cauſed the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> to vote him down from being a God, becauſe all his Diſciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were inconſiderable and beggarly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 48.</p>
               <p>Eightly, In his contentment with mean things: He had not a houſe where to lay his head, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 20. And 'tis ſaid, he was willing to be poor, <hi>For being rich he made himſelf poor, that we, through his poverty, might become rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8, 9. He was content with any fare, Barly Bread and Fiſhes; a broyled Fiſh, and an honey-comb, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 42. He was not as proud Perſons are, nice, and choice of his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et, but was pleaſed with any food, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 5. <hi>Children, have you any meat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, In his ſubmiſſive carriages towards God and men; when the Lord bruis'd him, and made his Soul an Offering for Sin, we find not one haſty or undue Expreſſion: But, 'tis ſaid, He was led as a Sheep dumb before her Shearer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4, 6, 7. All that he ſaid, was this humble complaint, O God, my
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48427:91"/> God, why haſt thou forſaken me? He was rejected and deſpiſed of men, and yet maintain'd an humble deportment, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. He was lowly to all Perſons, not only to the high and noble, but to the poor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable; not only to Friends but to Enemies; not only abroad but at home; not only among the meek and humble, but among the proud and peeviſh; not when it was admired, but when deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, In his doing the meaneſt Services: He condeſcended to the loweſt, and moſt contemptible actions, if he might adminiſter good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28. He girded himſelf with a Towel, as a Servant, and waſhed his Diſciples feet, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In his patient bearing others Sins, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Proud men cannot endure to bear another's Fault, but Chriſt was willing to be numbred amongſt Tranſgreſſors, to be reckoned an Offender, and to bear the Sins of many, even of all that come unto him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. He humbled himſelf to the Death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. To a ſhameful Death; the Death of the greateſt Malefactors; and to the curſed Death of the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord Jeſus was not only humble whilſt on Earth, when he paſs'd through his ſtate of Humiliation; but even now, when he is in Heaven, and hath entred into his Glory, he detains this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of heart. This will be perſpicuous, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, His Condeſcention to behold the things on Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. 5, 6. One would have thought it beneath the Dignity of Chriſt, now advanc'd above all Glory, to take any notice of Sublunar Affairs: but if he delighted in the habital Parts of the Earth, before he came down to redeem them, then much more now he hath the poſſeſſion of the fruit of his Blood among them.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:48427:92"/>
               <p> Secondly, His Converſes with the meaneſt, and moſt deſpicable Perſons on Earth, by his Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. 21, 23. Be they never ſo low and poor, yet, if holy, he takes up his abode with them, and keeps his Court amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His bowing down of his Ear to hear the cryes of his poor, and deſpiſed People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, Pſal.</hi> 31. 2. <hi>Bow down thine Ear to hear me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, His gentle and kind reception of their poor, pitiful Offerings and Services, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit, a broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, His owning them in the face of the World, before Kings and Rulers, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 16. 21. 22. <hi>He is not aſham'd to call them Brethren,</hi> Heb. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His appearing for them in Heaven, and confeſſing them before his Father's Face in Glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, His looking after their meaneſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and numbring the very hairs of their head, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 30.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, His ſlowneſs to Anger. But this properly pertains to another excellent Diſpoſition of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, namely his Meekneſs, where you may find it fully handled.</p>
               <p>Is Jeſus Chriſt of ſuch an humble, ſubmiſſive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition? then,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Admire the greatneſs of Divine Love, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Saviour, of ſo humble and lowly a Spirit: Had not the Son of God been of a condeſcending Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he would never have become man; and what then would have been the ſtate of Sinners? Had he not been of a lowly mind, he would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to have come into the World in the form of a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48427:92"/> Servant; and then enthralled Sinners could never have been made free: Had he not been humble, he would never have been willing to be made under the Law; and then the righteouſneſs of the Law had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been fulfilled: Had he not been lowly, he would never have borne our Fault and Puniſhment; and then our Sins muſt have been charged upon our own heads.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This will ſerve to ſhame the proud hearts of men, eſpecially thoſe that profeſs Chriſt: O, ſee the vileneſs of your Pride in the glaſs of Chriſt's Humility!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Labour to be like to Chriſt, and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with this excellent adorning Grace of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Here's Encouragement to humbled Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from the Lowlineſs of Chriſt: You that ſee your Iniquities to be heavier than you can bear, and are afraid becauſe of the Terrours of the Almighty; yet be encouraged to come to Chriſt, becauſe he is humble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. You that ſee no Worthineſs in your ſelves to come before him, but are fearful to approach into his Preſence, becauſe of your Poverty and low Eſtate; be encouraged to draw nigh to him, becauſe he is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 17. You that ſee an Infinite diſtance betwixt God and you, and ſo dare not approach him; let his Humility encourage you, he will not deſpiſe the Prayer of the deſtitute, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 17. You that think your Souls beneath the thoughts and care of ſuch a God, and that he will take no notice of you; O, conſider his Humility for your Hope, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. 6. Cheriſh expectations from Chriſt's Humility, for the mortification of your Pride; becauſe 'tis God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and appointment unto this end, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is ſhewn, the tranſcendent Meekneſs and Gentleneſs of Chriſt; To his Enemies, and to his People.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANother Branch of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Nature, is,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His Meekneſs: <hi>He is meek and lowly, Matth.</hi> 11. 29. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, facil and eaſie, (as Criticks derive it) becauſe they that have this Meekneſs, are of a gentle, pleaſing, and affable Spirit to others: The <hi>Latines</hi> expreſs it by <hi>Manſuetus,</hi> one uſed to the hand, alluding to thoſe wild Beaſts that are thus tamed; They are gentle, and brought to the hand; they are ſociable and familiar, not ſtrange and harſh: And ſuch is the Lord Jeſus; he is meek, of a ſweet and gentle Spirit and carriage towards all, when he opens himſelf as a Saviour to them, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he is ſo towards his People. Meekneſs eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relates to Anger, as allaying, and moderating of it; So <hi>Ariſt.</hi> defines it to be the ſweetning of ones Spirit, removing its roughneſs, harſhneſs, and Paſſion, and rendring it gentle, pleaſing, and affable, even to them that provoke it. Now this is an excellent Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. 'Tis ſpoken of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as one of his chiefeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Now the man Moſes was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meek.</hi> And the Lord Jeſus ſets forth this to be the greateſt Excellency that he preſents in himſelf for the Imitation of his People, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. When the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> would delineate the ſtately Majeſty of Chriſt, in his Kingly progreſs to his People, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes him in the Glory of his meekneſs, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Thy King cometh to thee meek,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 4. The
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48427:93"/> Glory of Chriſt in his triumphant March in the World, is held forth in his Meekneſs and Truth; this is part of Chriſt's excellent Glory, as Mediator, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>I beſeech you by the Meekneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Now the Lord Jeſus is repleniſhed with Meekneſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To his Enemies, This he manifeſted whilſt on Earth, to ſuch as hated him, abuſed him, and ſought to take away his Life; 'tis of ſuch the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9. compar'd with <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 5. Now this Meekneſs of Chriſt to his Enemies appears.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his Slowneſs to Anger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 8. <hi>The Lord is ſlow to Anger.</hi> He was not eaſily provoked whilſt on Earth, under all the Provocations and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes caſt upon him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>He ſhall not ſtrive nor cry, neither ſhall any man hear his Voice in the Streets.</hi> Paſſionate perſons will ſtrive to have their Will when croſt, to defend their Names, to oppoſe their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and to revile them that reproach them; but Chriſt was not ſo, he ſtrove not in a contentious, quarrelling way, but being reviled, reviled not again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. Under all his Sufferings, ſuch as were able to make the meekeſt man on Earth to cry out, and to ſtir up his Spirit againſt them, yet Chriſt was ſilent, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 7. <hi>He was oppreſſed, he was afflicted, and yet opened not his Mouth, he is brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before his Shearer is dumb, ſo he opened not his Mouth.</hi> You ſhall not find one froward Word from Chriſt in all his Sufferings, by <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> look over the Jeers and Reproaches that were caſt upon him in his Life, and at his Death; <hi>Is not this the Carpenter's Son,</hi> Matth. 13. 55. <hi>Is not this the Carpenter, the Son of</hi> Mary, Mark 6. 3.

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48427:94"/> that had Correſpondence with Devils, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 34. but he was ſilent: another time they call him a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 3. but ſee how mildly Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Why think ye Evil in your Hearts?</hi> Another time we find him ſleighted by the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes;</hi> he was coming to a Village in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and ſent Meſſengers to provide for him, but they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to entertain him, and take him in, becauſe his Face was as though he would go to <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 9. 51. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he ſeemed to be of another way of Religion: they could not endure him, becauſe he was for inſtituted Worſhip, and ſeem'd to profeſs a ſtricter way than the <hi>Samaritanes: He look'd like a Puritan</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Burroughs) and therefore they ſhut him out of their Houſes:</hi> now this was no ſmall abuſe, an ordinary Spirit would not bear to have a door ſhut againſt him; and hereupon, ſome of the Diſciples, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> pleaded for Revenge, and would have had Fire from Heaven to deſtroy them, <hi>ver.</hi> 54. Yet ſee the Meekneſs of Chriſt's Spirit under this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, <hi>ver.</hi> 55. <hi>He turned and rebuked them, and ſaid, ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of, for the Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens Lives, but to ſave them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In his mild Anſwers to them; how mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did he anſwer the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſaid, he was a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi> and had a Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8. 48. 49. All his Anſwer was, <hi>I have not a Devil, but I honour my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ye diſhonour me;</hi> ſee in that Chapter, how contradictorily and croſsly they behav'd themſelves to him, yet with what wonderful Gentleneſs he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers them: when <hi>Judas</hi> came to betray him, <hi>Matt:</hi> 26. 49. with what Calmneſs doth he treat him, <hi>verſe</hi> 50, <hi>Friend wherefore art thou come?</hi> Who could have given ſo gentle words to ſo vile a Traytor, but the Mirror of Meekneſs? <hi>Luke</hi> hath it thus, Judas <hi>betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:48427:94"/> 
                  <hi>thou the Son of man with a kiſs? Luke.</hi> 22. 48. what thou <hi>Judas</hi> my Diſciple, who haſt been ſo long with me, known my Kindneſs, and eat and drunk at my table? what thou betray the Son of man, and combine to take away thy Maſter's life? canſt thou find in thy heart to deal ſo treacherouſly with thy Lord? How did he reprove <hi>Peter</hi> for ſmiting the High-prieſt's Servant that came to take him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 51. to 55. How ſcornfully did they treat him? <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 61. <hi>This Fellow ſaith I am able to deſtroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days;</hi> but he held his Peace, <hi>v.</hi> 63. The <hi>Jews</hi> mocked him, blind-folded, and ſmote him, <hi>Luke</hi> 26. 63. <hi>Herod</hi> with his men of War ſet him at nought, <hi>chap.</hi> 23. 11. <hi>The Rulers derided him, ſaying, others he ſaved, let him ſave himſelf if he be the Chriſt the choſen of God, ver.</hi> 35.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the Offices of Love, he ſhews them; he went about doing Good to his very Enemies, heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coals of Fire on their Heads, healing their ſick, feeding their hungry, and preaching the Goſpel to their poor, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 5. His pitying them ſhews his Meekneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41. He beheld the City, and wept over it: now this Meekneſs of Chriſt as it is excellent in it ſelf, ſo 'tis eminent in degree; 'tis large, and abundant Meekneſs; weigh but theſe following Conſiderations, and you will ſay the ſame.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Greatneſs of thoſe Provocations he hath received from them; Sinners under the Goſpel make light of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 5. They deſpiſe him, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 4. They reject him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48. They rebel againſt him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 20. They crucifie him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 15. They blaſpheme his Name, they belye his Truth, abuſe his Love, undervalue his Blood, trampling it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48427:95"/> under Foot, deny his Right, defraud, and injure his Intereſt, rob him of his Glory, hate his People, and ſeek to hinder his Kingdom, and yet he mildly puts up theſe high Indignities; Oppreſſion will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ake a wiſe man mad, but cannot render Chriſt ungentle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Continuance of theſe Provocations; All the day long have I ſtretched out my hand to a gain-ſaying people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 2. every day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 5. Three years, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 7. Forty years, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 9. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. And it is no ſmall Provocation to have a Tryal lye on a perſons back, yet ſee the Lothneſs of Chriſt to deſtroy his very Enemies; he waits that he may be gracious, and beſeeches them to turn and live, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The greatneſs of his Perſon, he is the Majeſty on high, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16. He hath Right to Service and Worſhip from all his Creatures, <hi>To him every Knee muſt bow, and Tongue confeſs, Phil.</hi> 2. 9. and yet that he ſhould bear ſo meekly, the Abuſes, Scorns, and Contempts of the vileſt men, is wonderful: great men are ſoon incenſed when their Honour and Intereſt are invaded; but the Lord Jeſus is great, and yet meek, a King, and yet lowly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 3, 4. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Deſpicableneſs of the Perſons that abuſe him; they are his Creatures, made, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain'd by him, inferiour Worms whom he can cruſh every Moment, and ſtrike dead with his Look, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 45. 9.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The great Kindneſs he hath for them, he comes in their Errand to ſave their Souls, he ſheds his blood, that they might live, underwent the Law, and bore his Fathers Wrath, that they might enjoy his Favour, and be ſav'd to the uttermoſt if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: and is not this a wonderful Diſcovery of his Meekneſs?</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:48427:95"/>
               <p> Secondly, His Meekneſs to his People is exceeding great, as I ſhall illuſtrate in a few particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his bearing with them, he did not only bear their Sins for them when on the Tree, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Provocations and Abuſes from them now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo he bore with the <hi>Iſraelites, Iſa.</hi> 3. 8. Though their Tongue and their Doings was againſt the Lord to provoke the Eyes of his Glory; this was not the Carriage of Heathens, but of his own People; their Provocations was not a ſingle Act from one part of them, but the whole Body combine againſt him in Word and Deed: theſe were not ſuppoſed Injuries, but real; not intermitted, but continued; not ſeldom but frequent. How oft did they provoke him in the Wilderneſs, and griev'd him in the Deſart, they tempted him, limitted him, and murmured againſt him for Water, for Bread and for Fleſh: they rebell'd againſt him, againſt his Inſtitutions, in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> againſt his Command about gathering <hi>Manna,</hi> ſanctifying the Sabbath, and going againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. They continually provok'd him to Anger, even to his very Face, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 3. vexed and grieved his holy Spirit, and yet he bears it in the Wilderneſs for forty years, in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> eight hundred and ſixty years before the Captivity; after this, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ninety, and ſix years before he caſt them off. O the admirable length of the Patience and Meekneſs of Chriſt towards that People, in bearing with them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Kind and Length of their Provocations: ſo under the Goſpel, he hath a people redeemed by his Blood, ſuch as avouch him for their Lord, and tread in his Courts; now to theſe alſo he exerciſeth much Long-ſuffering and Patience if you weigh,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Multitude of their Sins, they are more than can be numbred, more than the hairs of their head, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 12. Sins of Thoughts, Words, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48427:96"/> Deeds; Sins againſt Law and Goſpel, the firſt and ſecond Table; Sins in Duty and out of Duty; Sins every day, every moment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. Sins to the laſt hour of their Lives, till their Tabernacle be pull'd down, and the body of Death deſtroyed; and this is not only the Condition of one, or of a few Souls, but of all the Elect, every man that liveth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 46. <hi>There is none that ſinneth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Aggravation of their Sins taken,</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the perſons ſinning, The redeemed of God, ſuch as have been bought with a great price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. The pardon of whoſe former Sins coſt ſo dear, the Sons and Daughters of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 19. Souls loved and choſen out of all the World, to be his; yea they only elected, and all others left, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. Adopted to a glorious ſtate, to be Kings and Prieſts unto God, to be Heirs and Co-heirs with Chriſt, to be a name and a Glory to him; and yet for theſe to be always grieving, always provoking, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reproaching of him, is hard indeed, but not too hard for Chriſt to bear.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From the perſon againſt whom they ſin, they ſin againſt their Father who loved them with an everlaſting Love, drew them with the Cords of Love, and led them in the paths of Love, who hath given his Son for them, and to them, and fixed his unchangeable Love upon them, imparted the royal Priviledges of Sons to them, and yet to Sin againſt him who is the Father of Chriſt, and their Father, whoſe Glory was dearer to him than his own Blood, is an aggravated Sin indeed.</p>
               <p>They ſin againſt God the Son, who gave himſelf for them, and bought them with a great price.</p>
               <p>They ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, who viſited them in their low Eſtate, and brought them the good
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48427:96"/> News of Salvation; who broke open their Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors, and let them forth into a glorious State of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; who quickned, enlightned, comforted, and helped them in all their Soul-ſtraits; now to ſin againſt this God the Father, Son, and Spirit, cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly provoke the Soul of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the State in which they ſin; O! how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent is this with ſuch an high and glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.. <hi>Sin ſhall have no more Dominion over you, becauſe you are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> The Sins of ſuch are the works of Darkneſs in the day time, Acts of Enmity in a ſtate of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and grievous Bondage in times of Liberty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The dangerous Effects of their Sinning; 'Tis a corrupt Tree that brings forth ſad Fruit, even the Grapes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Wine of <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> their Sins rob God of his Glory, and bring a greater Diſhonour to him than all the Sins of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 23. They grieve the Spirit of Chriſt whereby they are ſeal'd up to the day of Redemption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. They depreſs and load, yea break the Heart of God, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 13. They endeavour to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate divine grace, and render the Death of Chriſt in vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. They do (as it were) reduce the Lord to a great ſtrait, what to do to ſave their Souls, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſ.</hi> 6. 4. they Shipwrack all their Duties, and put a Vanity upon all their Profeſſion, Labours, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; ſuch run in vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 2. They ſadden the Hearts, and weaken the hands of the Godly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtumbling blocks in their way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 158. And they do a great deal of miſchief to the wicked in prejudicing them againſt the Lord Jeſus, and his holy ways, in hindring their Reception of the Goſpel, and depriving them of the Fruits and Labours of Chriſt towards their Converſion, in juſtifying them
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48427:97"/> in their wayes, encouraging them in their Sins, and in cauſing them to blaſpheme the holy Name of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The bleſſed Advantages they have enjoy'd againſt their Sins; they have many Obligations againſt it, and many Experiences of the Evil of it, and yet ſtill continue in it: O, this doth make the burden of the Sins of the Godly exceeding heavy to Chriſt, and yet that he ſhould bear them ſo patiently, and not conſume them: That, though provoked daily by the Brambles, and ſcratching Abominations of his People, yet his Fury ſhould not be kindled into a terrible Flame to burn them up, doth manifeſtly demonſtrate his meekneſs to be exceeding great.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt's forbearing of his People, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence of his Slowneſs to Anger: He is not eaſily provoked, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 17. How long doth he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear before he ſtrikes? he firſt threatens, and then waits, calls and exhorts, ſhakes the rod, and then ſtrikes gently, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 18. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, His readineſs to be reconciled to them, when angry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 5. <hi>Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive.</hi> O, conſider his perſwading them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; how doth he labour to convince them of their Sin, and invite them to return; he entreats, reaſons, and beſeecheth them to be reconciled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. Lo, how affectionately doth he receive them when they return! how willingly doth he liſten his Ear to their confeſſion of Sin, and bemoaning of their condition? <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The moderation of his Anger, when rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhews his meekneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 7, 8. <hi>In meaſure when it ſhooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it. He ſtayeth his rough wind in the day of his Eaſt-wind,</hi> Job. 11. 6.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:48427:97"/>
               <p> Laſtly, His actual forgiving all their Iniquities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 3. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities, Luke</hi> 7. 47. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Now, if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be ſo full of meekneſs to his very Enemies, ſo rich in gentleneſs, ſweetneſs of Nature, and Patience to his People, then learn this needful Leſſon of him; to be of a meek and patient Spirit. Behold, how quietly he took up his Croſs, and bore reproaches and Indignities from the worſt of men: yea, how ſtill he was under the infinite weight of his Father's wrath. Learn meekneſs from his Gentleneſs, as the Elephant doth from the Lamb; when the Elephant is in his greateſt Fury, ſet but a Lamb before him, and his wrath will preſently be allay'd: Learn of Chriſt to bear Injuries, to reſtrain your Anger, not to be angry, but when Duty, and the Cauſe of God calls you to it: 'Tis onely Sin ſhould be the Object of a Chriſtian's Anger. <hi>Moſes</hi> was calm at his own Reproaches, but could not be ſtill when God was diſhonoured. Learn from Chriſt to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the meaſure of your Anger; he corrects in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Let not your Anger exceed the deſert of the Provocation; Learn from him to time your Anger. As a word fitly ſpoken, ſo Anger ſeaſonably exerted is beautiful: and learn from him to remove it when the Cauſe is gone. Anger ſhould be as Phyſick, laid aſide when there is no need of it: True meekneſs may eaſily be diſcerned by its ends and grounds, it muſt not proceed from a willingneſs to be aveng'd on others, but to amend and reform them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is demonſtrated the infinite Bounty of Chriſt to all his Creatures, with the manner of his giving.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE next thing which diſcovers the ſweetneſs of Chriſt's Diſpoſition, and greatneſs of his Perſonal Treaſure, is,</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His Liberality: He is of a bountiful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and this, you know, is of an endearing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man ſome would even dare to dye.</hi> Pſal. 13. 6. <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, becauſe he hath dealt bountifully with me.</hi> Now this Liberality of Chriſt appears,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To all his Creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 9. <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works, Pſal.</hi> 136. 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 15. Whoſe heart is ſo large, whoſe hand ſo wide as Chriſt's? <hi>ver.</hi> 16. He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all things by the word of his Power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. And by him all things conſiſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 17. There is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a moment but he is laying out upon his Creatures, and that muſt needs be a large Treaſure that maintains the whole World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To his Enemies: He doth good to thoſe that hate him: He gives large portions of this World's goods to <hi>Eſau</hi>'s: And uncharitable <hi>Dives's</hi> do many times fare deliciouſly, and are cloathed gorgeouſly, by his Bounty, <hi>The wicked proſper, Jer.</hi> 5. 28. Nay, he doth not only give them the fat things of this Life, but the great things of his Kingdome. O, the Privileges and Favours that Hypocrites enjoy as well as Saints! He ſends his Goſpel to every Creature, and cauſeth the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48427:98"/> very Dews of <hi>Sion</hi> to fall upon his Adverſaris.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Eſpecially to his Children; for to theſe he gives,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Good things: Whatever they have of him ſhall be good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>I will not turn away from them to do them good.</hi> Their very Afflictions are for good: their Wormwood and Gall is good: Rebukes of God upon them, ſtripping and humbling Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; nay, their very Corruptions, by this Bounty, prove to their advantage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All good things. <hi>He gives Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84. 11. Pſal. 34. 10. All the good God ſees fit for them, and they are capable to receive, ſhall be diſtributed to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Great things: Not Common, but choice Mercies, paſſing Knowledge, Myſteries, not onely to the World, but to themſelves: Things unſearchable, and things unutterable; Things that cannot be known as they are, nor valued as they deſerve. <hi>What one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to God) <hi>is like thy People, whom God went to redeem for a People to himſelf, to make him a Name, and to do for them great things and terrible,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 23. Redemption-work brings forth great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things, for redeemed Souls. O, the great things that God doth, and Chriſt gives to every ranſom'd Soul, <hi>Job,</hi> 37. 5. Things which we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, as you will ſee, if you give but a general Survey on the Inventory of Chriſt's Gifts. I ſhall inſtance in ſome of the moſt remarkable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That unvaluable Gift of Light. He is the Light of the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 12. How deformed is Darkneſs, how beautiful is Light, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>He is a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 2. 32. <hi>He is the bright Morning Star:</hi> the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48427:99"/> from whom the light of Life and all true Wiſdom comes; now this is a great and excellent thing, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Wiſdom excelleth Folly, as far as Light excelleth Darkneſs,</hi> and this you know is very far: Wiſdom is preferred before Rubies, and the moſt excellent things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. from <hi>ver.</hi> 10. to 20. That muſt needs be great which all the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not purchaſe, but this is Wiſdom: now all true Wiſdom comes by Jeſus Chriſt, he is the Wiſdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. So, who hath brought to light the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the hidden things of God, and that could by no ways be known but by Revelation: <hi>No man hath known the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son ſhall reveal him,</hi> Matth. 11. 27. He giveth Knowledge and Wiſdom to whom he pleaſeth, that ſpecial Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which none of the Princes of this World can attain unto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Life; <hi>He hath brought Life to Light by the Goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. and is not this a great gift? <hi>All that a man hath will he give for his Life, Job.</hi> 2. 4. O! then what is Life from the dead to his people, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>He is our Life, Col.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>I am come that they may have Life, and have it more abundantly,</hi> Joh. 10. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Love; all the World and Houſes full of Treaſures cannot be compar'd to Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 7. Should Chriſt give all the World and withhold his Heart, it were but a mean gift: Favours are valuable by the love whence they come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them, Pſal.</hi> 63. 3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 3. All Believers are ſet as a Seal upon his Heart, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6. He hath loved them with an everlaſting Love; they have his Heart, and none elſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Himſelf; There being nothing greater than himſelf, to demonſtrate the Largeneſs of his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48427:99"/> Heart to his people; he gave himſelf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Who loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it;</hi> that is, ſold himſelf to purchaſe them, gave himſelf to divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to ſatisfie the Law, and to taſte of Death for them, all that he had as Mediator he parted with for them: and hath given himſelf to them alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>And I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> They have his perſon, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be for another, ſo will I alſo be for thee.</hi> All his Beauties and perſonal Perfections, as deſcribed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to the end: all Believers have a Marriage right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by way of Gift; again, he hath given them his Purchaſe, all that he hath bought with his Blood, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, ſhed for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, His Laws and Scepter to guide them through the World, and to ſteer out their Courſe of Duty and Safety, and this is a great thing, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>I have written to him the great things of my Law (Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bab)</hi> the excellent or honourable things of my Law: for this word notes Quality as well as Quantity; and if the things of God's Law are ſo great, what are the Truths of the Goſpel, called ſo great Salvation? <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>And what Nation is ſo great that hath Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Judgments ſo righteous?</hi> Pſal. 147. 19.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His Spirit; This he gives to all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>If any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13, <hi>We are all by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit baptized into one body:</hi> This is promiſed by the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly, His Promiſes; <hi>For in him are all the Promiſes of God, yea, and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. That is, they are ſure and certain in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are given unto us, exceeding great and precious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Gal. 3. 22.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48427:100"/>
               <p> Laſtly, His Kingdom; <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>And hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> A bleſſed Change indeed, from Sin to Grace, from Darkneſs to Light, from the Kingdom of <hi>Satan,</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>So an Entrance ſhall be adminiſtred to you abundantly into the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All Believers are inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the glorious Priviledges of this Kingdom, they all become Kings and Prieſts unto God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. Nay a Kingdom of Prieſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 6. They are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to all the royal Endowments, Inveſtments, and Favours that belong to the Children of a King; they all wear his royal Robes of Glory, they have noble Entertainment, moſt delicious Food, the higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Thrones to ſit on; Chriſt gives them the Inheritance, purchaſed Poſſeſſions and Manſions of Glory.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Liberality of Chriſt appears in the manner of his giving, now this may come under a ſix-fold Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He gives readily and propenſly: many give, but by Conſtraint, as the unjuſt Judge, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. or from fear of Shame or Reproach; men uſually give with Reluctancy, but Chriſt readily, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Church of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 3. that they were prone to Charity beyond their power; and of <hi>Titus, ver.</hi> 17. that being more forward of his own accord he went unto them; ſo it may be more truly ſaid of Chriſt, that he wants no external Motives or Perſwaſions to exert his Bounty. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt's Gifts are his peoples due, they have Right to all his Fullneſs; Chriſt is the Believers and all that is his, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 3. I am my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved's and my beloved is mine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>For all things are yours,</hi> they are purchas'd for them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:48427:100"/>
               <p> Secondly, Chriſt's Office and publick Deſignation to this Work ſhews it, he is ſet apart for this end, that he might be the Author of eternal Life, the Giver of all that good that his people need, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>As thou haſt given him Power over all Fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal Life, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 6. 27. <hi>Him hath God the Father ſealed;</hi> that is, deputed to this Office and Truſt, to be the Lord keeper of his Houſe, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of his Fathers Goods. All that Chriſt hath as Mediator, is to be diſtributed to his: he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but muſt be employed for the Salvation of the Elect, for ſuch is the Agreement betwixt the Father and him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He hath never the leſs for giving, and therefore never weary of giving; what's that makes men ſoon tyred with Acts of Bounty, why becauſe the more they give the leſs they have, and ſo fail at laſt in their Ability; but 'tis not ſo with Chriſt, he is Fullneſs ſtill, notwithſtanding all the vaſt Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that go out of his Treaſury every day, to fill up Heaven and Earth, Men and Angels. (I remember a notable ſaying of a worthy Divine, <hi>Should all the World</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſet themſelves to drink free Grace, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Pardon, dry, drawing Water continually from the Wells of Salvation, nay if they ſhould ſet themſelves to draw from one ſingle Promiſe, an Angel ſtanding by and crying, drink O my Friends, drink abundantly, take ſo much Grace and Pardon as ſhall be abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the world of Sins which is in every one of you, they would not be able to ſink the Grace of the Promiſe, one Hairs breath.)</hi> When Beggers come to our doors, they many times promiſe us, upon the Reception of an Alms, they will trouble us no more, but this would be an improper Expreſſion to Chriſt, whoſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48427:101"/> Heart is ſo propenſe to give, and whoſe Treaſures are inexhauſtible, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>For in him dwells all the Fullneſs of the God-head bodily,</hi> Col. 1. 19.</p>
               <p>Forthly, He gets by giving; Advantage is a ſure Agreement, all men ſeek their own, every man his gain from his Quarter: now if giving appears to be Chriſt's Advantage, you may be ſure he will be willing to give; men laviſh out their Gold for Idolatry, carnal perſons pour out their whole Wealth upon their Luſts, the Merchant adventures all he hath for Gain, and can you think that Chriſt only will be cloſe handed? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. Here 'tis ſaid, he receives Gifts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. 'Tis ſaid, he gave gifts: what Chriſt receiv'd was not for himſelf, but to give unto Sinners, and that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Dwelling amongſt them; Chriſt's Gifts are to further his Service, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. and his Peoples Profit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He is never more pleaſed, than when he gives; This appears in his earneſt inviting Souls to ask of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 24. <hi>Hitherto you have asked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my Name, ask that your Joy may be full.</hi> Had not the Lord Jeſus a great Delight to diſpenſe freely to his People, he would not have us'd ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade them to beg; 'tis ſaid of <hi>Titus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſian,</hi> that he never denyed any thing to thoſe that asked him, but would call upon them, to ask ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This doth wonderfully greaten his Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Whatever ye ask in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> This verſe ſhews the Reaſon why the Saints ſhall do greater works than thoſe that Chriſt did, becauſe they ſhall have the Power of Chriſt to help them; he will do for them what they ask, and give them what they ſeek; and the reaſon is, becauſe hereby the divine Glory is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48427:101"/> more manifeſted, the Fathers Glory in the Sons Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for the Father and he are one, and the Fathers Glory is his Glory, the more he gives, the more the Father is glorified, and the more the Father is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the more is the Son alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He gives feeely without any reſpect to Merit or Compenſation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 6. <hi>To him that is a thirſt, will I give to drink of the Water of Life freely.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) That is, without any antecedent Cauſe, Worth or Merit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace.</hi> As Juſtification comes freely without any Worth or Righteouſneſs in man, ſo do all the gifts of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. How can he but with him freely give us all things? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. Chriſt doth not ſell but give his Favours freely, according to the pleaſure of his own Will, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. This is a Truth hard to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, becauſe 'tis beyond the reaſon of men, how Grace ſhould move without any Motives and Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives beſides it ſelf, but yet this bounty of Chriſt hath no reſpect of Perſons, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He gives preſently Mercies in hand, he doth not ſay as the unjuſt and covetous man, go, and come again to morrow, and I will give it thee, when 'tis by him; he doth not delay to beſtow Mercies on his poor Creatures, one Jot beyond the due time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. Chriſt is never at a loſs to give, he only ſtays for a fit time; he had many things to ſay to his Diſciples, but he wanted a convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; they were not able to bear them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He gives heartily; <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 41. <hi>I will rejoyce over them to do them good, with my whole Heart, and with my whole Soul.</hi> He doth not pretend Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet begrudge it in his Heart, all his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are the Intents of his Heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 18. <hi>Do Good in thy good Pleaſure to</hi> Sion.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:48427:102"/>
               <p> Fifthly, He gives liberally, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>If any man lack Wiſdom, let him ask it of God who giveth liberally.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Simply, purely, with a candid Mind and full Intent to do good: 'tis rendred bountifully, as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality comes from a ſimple and pure Heart, he gives many times more than we ask, as the ſick man of the Palſie came for Health, and Chriſt gave him Pardon to boot; <hi>Solomon</hi> asked Wiſdom, and God gave him more than he begged, Riches and Honour too, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 3. 12. 13. He gives richly to his People of all good things to enjoy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. Sutable to his Treaſures, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 10. According to his Riches in Glory by Chriſt, above what we can ask or think, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20. He gives a Kingdom, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 22. and therefore bids us open our Mouths wide, and he will fill them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 10.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He gives conſtantly every day and every moment, he is never weary of well-doing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 28. <hi>The Lord fainteth not, neither is weary;</hi> men are ſoon tyred with Acts of Bounty, to which the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. But the Lord Jeſus is a Fountain that never ceaſeth running, he is always doing, there is never a moment but he is opening his Treaſures and filling the hungry Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 26. <hi>God is my Portion for ever.</hi> The Saints are always living on God, and are ever receiving from him, <hi>His Mercies are new every Morning, Lam.</hi> 3. 23. Yea though through Careleſneſs they have loſt their Mercies, as the Spouſe loſt the preſence of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. and the Taſtes of his Love, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. 6. And though by Sin they have forfeited their Mercies, and have given the Lord cauſe to withhold them, yet he is never weary of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them good, but always communicating ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other to them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the Faithfulneſs of Chriſt is opened, in accompliſhing all his Propheſies, fulfilling his Promiſes to all the Truſt committed to him, and in all the Relations he ſtands to his People.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Sweetneſs and Excellency of Chriſt's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition conſiſts alſo.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In his Juſtice and Fidelity; he is righteous, true, and faithful in all he doth and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and this argues an excellent Spirit; this was part of that Glory, the Spirit of God puts on <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>But my Servant Moſes is not ſo, who is faithful in all my Houſe, with him will I ſpeak Mouth to Mouth:</hi> even apparently, God puts a ſingular Value on <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath a peculiar kindneſs for him, and affords him more intimacy with himſelf than others have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Faithfulneſs: So <hi>Daniel,</hi> It was his great Honour that his very Enemies could not ſpot him, or find any Error in him, on the account of his Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 4. 'Twas this brought <hi>Judah</hi> into ſo high an Eſtimation with God, as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Judah ruled with God, and was faithful with the Saints.</hi> Nay a faithful perſon is a Jewel ſo rare, that he can ſcarcely be found, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>Every man will proclaim his own Goodneſs, but a faithful man, who can find?</hi> That is, as ſome render it, <hi>'Tis a common thing for men to talk of their Goodneſs, Bounty and Mercy, but 'tis a rare thing for them to be ſo indeed, to be ſo good as they ſeem to be.</hi> Others comment on it thus, <hi>'Tis an eaſie thing for men to promiſe fair, and to ſpeak of great things they will do, but few are found that perform their word, and are what they promiſe to be.</hi> Take it in either Senſe, a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48427:103"/> faithful man is a rare thing, who can find it, as ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen almoſt, as a black Swan, or a rich Jewel. Now the Lord Jeſus is thus excellent, he is true, though every man be a Lyer, called <hi>the faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Rev.</hi> 1. 5. His Name as well as Nature is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. The Lord Jeſus gives a faithful Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the love that God bears to Sinners, he lay in the Fathers boſom, and hath given a true Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>Faithfulneſs is the Girdle of his Reins.</hi> The Prophet alludes to thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, Kings did uſe to wear; they wore a Girdle as an Enſign of Honour and Power, <hi>Job</hi> 12. 18. <hi>He looſeth the bonds of Kings,</hi> that is, their Girdle, by which he means their Power and Authority, which he removes: now inſtead of this Enſign of Honour which Kings did wear, Chriſt ſhall be cloathed with Faithfulneſs and Righteouſneſs, this ſhall be his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>He is the faithful high-prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, He is faithful and juſt to all men, even to his very Enemies, he will not wrong them in the leaſt; he renders to every one his due, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6. The very Hypocrites ſhall have their Reward, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 2. The Lord Jeſus will not give cauſe to any to ſay at the laſt day, that he is their Debtor, or doth them Wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 13. The wicked ſhall have their Portion in this Life, all that is coming to them, as much as they can in Juſtice demand. If <hi>Ahab</hi> repent he ſhall have Reprieve from his Puniſhment; eternal Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall obtain eternal Deliverance. If <hi>Eſau</hi> pray for the Bleſſings of this life with Tears, God will give them to him, he cannot be a Debtor to any; his very Enemies ſhall have their due, as much as their outward Duties or ſervile Labours amount to; for the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cannot lye, what Promiſe ſoever
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48427:104"/> God makes to any outward Action or Vertue, it ſhall certainly be fulfilled, he cannot defraud any; the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſhall have their Honour, <hi>Judas</hi> his bag; <hi>Demas</hi> the World, and <hi>Dives</hi> his Pleaſures: he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his People to render every one their due, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly wrong any.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is faithful to his People, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Let them that ſuffer according to the Will of God commit the keeping of their Souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful Creator:</hi> That is, Chriſt is able to keep you in Sufferings becauſe he made you of nothing, and he that gave you a being when you were nothing, he can keep you now, though all the World be ſet againſt you: He can do it becauſe he created you of nothing, and he will do it, becauſe he is faithful, and hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; now this Faithfulneſs of Chriſt to his people lies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his exact Accompliſhment of all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, <hi>All things written concerning him, are fulfilled in him, Luke</hi> 18. 31. A tittle of God's word ſhall not fall to the ground, all the Types and legal Figures as they ſhadowed out Chriſt to come, namely, the High-prieſt, the Altar, the ſcape Goat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accompliſht in him, they were the Shadows, he the Subſtance; all Scripture Propheſies concerning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, the Reſurrection of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall be fulfilled to one Iota, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 22.</p>
               <p>Secondly in performing his Promiſes, never an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement made by the Father to the Son, or by him to his people, but he will ſee it aſſuredly made good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 28. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his Promiſes,</hi> Tit. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 20. <hi>All the Promiſes are in him, yea, and</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Chriſt's Faithfulneſs in fulfilling his Promiſes pertains only to the Heirs of the Promiſes: but I cannot</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:48427:104"/> 
                  <hi>call the Promiſes mine, becauſe of my unfaithfulneſs to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Promiſes of God are not made to the Doers of the Law or Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pel, but to Believers: nor are they made for doing, but upon believing: 'Tis true, by Faithfulneſs and Obedience comes the thing promiſed, but a Title to the Promiſes is procured by believing; pray put a diſtinction between the Promiſes, and the thing promiſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>That the promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, might be given to them that believe,</hi> Heb. 6. 17, 18. The promiſe of Grace, Healing, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, depends not upon the fidelity of the ſaved Soul, but upon the faithfulneſs of God, in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But I do not find the Promiſes made good to me; God hath ſaid, He will never leave nor forſake his People, but, I doubt, he hath forſaken me; for I cannot ſee his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings in the Sanctuary: He hath promiſed to hear the Prayers made in his Name; to diſpence Grace, to give out his Spirit, and to create a new heart; but I find not the performance of theſe things in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, If the Lord Jeſus doth not fulfill his Promiſes, 'tis becauſe thou art not fit for them: God would have brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> near forty years before he did, but they were not fit for that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: They were carnal, luſting, murmuring, rebelling, ſo that God ſent them back again into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Chriſt would have taught his People many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Truths, but they were not able to bear them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 12. Food, yea, the choiceſt Dainties, upon a diſtempered Stomach, are caſt away, they feed nothing but the Diſeaſe: If God accompliſh not his Word to thee, 'tis becauſe thou art uncapable for it: Thy Iniquities, it may be, withhold good things from thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt may be performing his Promiſes though thou doſt not ſee it: For,</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:48427:105"/>
               <p> Firſt, Chriſt doth fulfill his Promiſe, though he doth not give the ſame thing he ſeems to promiſe: If he give thee that which is equivalent in the room of it: So, if the Lord doth not give his People the Comforts of this Life, yet if he gives them Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without them, he fulfills his Promiſe; So he dealt with <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>I have learned in every ſtate to be contented;</hi> and with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 16. 6. The Diſciples had nothing, yet in the want of all, they had all things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. If in the want of Bread, God gives Strength and Satisfaction, he fulfills his Word. The wicked in their Fulneſs are in Straits, <hi>Joh,</hi> 20. 22. But the Godly in their Straits have a Fulneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth fulfill his Promiſe, though he gives not the ſame thing, if he gives a better thing: If Chriſt withholds Earthly things, and gives Spiritual; As <hi>Saul</hi> found not his Aſſes, but in the room of them met with a Kingdom: The Diſciples loſt their Nets and Boats, and found a Treaſure in Chriſt: They loſt their taking of Fiſh, and became Fiſhers of men: <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffer'd a Shipwrack of all his own Excellencies, and found the Excellencies of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt fulfills his Promiſes, though he do not give the ſame things his People would have, yet, if he gives them ſutable things, ſuch as he ſees beſt ſutes and fits their preſent ſtate: So the Diſciples ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Temporal Kingdom, but Chriſt gave them a Spiritual Kingdom. It may be a little Mercy is more ſutable for thee than a great deal; Children muſt have their meat ſuted to their Health, not their Stomach: <hi>Paul</hi> could not bear much Viſion of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt have a Thorn in the Fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt doth fulfill his Promiſe, though he doth not give thee what thou thinkeſt thou doſt want, if he give thee what he knows thou wanteſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48427:105"/> Thou ſuppoſeſt thou wanteſt Comforts, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them, and gives thee humblings.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt fulfills his Promiſe, though he doth not deliver thee out of thy preſent Evils, if he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preſerves thee from a greater Evil: As <hi>Paul</hi> had a thorn in the Fleſh, the Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him; leſt, through the abundance of Revelations, he ſhould be puffed up, and his Soul in danger of Ruine.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt doth fulfill his Promiſe, if he doth it in his own time, though he doth it not in our time. So in <hi>Abraham;</hi> God promiſed him a Son, he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it many years ſooner, but God kept it till the moſt convenient ſeaſon. Every thing is beautiful in its ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6. Mercies are Afflictions, when out of due time: Now, 'tis he that gives the Mercy, can beſt tell when to give it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49. 19. <hi>Who will appoint me the time, Lev.</hi> 26. 4. The Faithfulneſs of Chriſt is firm and unalterable, whatever Objections Unbelief makes againſt it. He will perform all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goeſt, and will bring thee again into this Land, for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have ſpoken to thee of.</hi> O what a bleſſed word is this! 'Tis a promiſe made to <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was to undertake a difficult Journey; and what things are written, are written for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; Promiſes made to particular Saints, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to all the Saints in the ſame condition; as we find that of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> 1. 5. <hi>I will not leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee.</hi> The Apoſtle makes Uſe of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. Now I ſhall give a few Reaſons to prove that Chriſt cannot fail of fulfilling his Promiſe. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is Truth it ſelf, and cannot lye, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 14. He is called, <hi>The Amen, the faithful and true Witneſs:</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:48427:106"/> 
                  <hi>The Holy one of Iſrael, who cannot lye: For, God is not as man that he ſhould lye, or as the Son of man, that he ſhould repent; hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it, hath be ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> Numb. 23. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He came to fulfill all Righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>It becometh us to fulfil all Righteouſneſs:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It behoveth us, I ought to do it, by the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Will of my Father, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> renders it: Chriſt came into the World to fulfill all Righteouſneſs; Now, to perform and make good the Promiſes of God, is part of this Righteouſneſs: 'tis a debt God is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in, and Chriſt came not only to pay Sinners debts to the Father, but to make good the Father's Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Did not Chriſt fulfill all the Promiſes of God to Believers, then the New Covenant would be an imperfect and faulty Covenant; were the Promiſes of the new Covenant unfulfilled, then it would be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo imperfect: But the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is eſtabliſht on better Promiſes, <hi>Heh.</hi> 8. 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now new Covenant-promiſes are better than the old, not only as to the Matter of them, but as to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their performance. The firſt Covenant-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were liable to be broken, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32. But theſe New Covenant-promiſes are ſure to all the Seed. This was the principal thing undertaken in the New Covenant, for Believers, that the Promiſes ſhould be certainly fulfilled, and therefore 'tis called a better Covenant than the Old.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt muſt needs fulfill the Promiſes, or he would die in vain, and ſhed his Blood to no purpoſe: for the Blood of Chriſt is the Blood of the Covenant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. and it was ſhed on purpoſe to confirm the truth of the Promiſe to all that believe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. For this end he came into the World, and became a Mediator, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8, 9.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:48427:106"/>
               <p> Fifthly, That he might finiſh the Work the Father gave him to do, and ſo give up his Account with joy. This is the Work God ſent Chriſt into the World for, that he might be the Mediator of the New Covenant, and make good the Will of God to all the Federates thereof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 38. to 41. and this Chriſt cannot fail to perform, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. His Spirit ſhall not fail, till he hath ſet Judgment on the Earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 4.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That he may ſtop the mouth of Devils, and prove Satan a Lyar. The great work of Satan is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye God, and repreſent him to Sinners Unfaithful and untrue. Now Chriſt is to fight againſt the Devil, and deſtroy his Works, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. and prove the Truth of God againſt all oppoſers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, He is fully able to do it; He hath all Power in his hand, both in Heaven and in Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. He is a merciful God, and ſo nothing is too hard for him: He will work, and none ſhall let it; beſides, he hath all that Grace and Goodneſs that poor Souls need, in his own hand; He hath received the Spirit without meaſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. All Fulneſs dwells in him; Name any thing which thou ſtandeſt in need of, which is not in Chriſt to give thee. Doſt thou want Pardon, Peace of Conſcience, Grace, Holineſs, Power over thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, Victory over thy Temptations, Comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Troubles, ſatisfaction of thy Doubts, quieting of thy Fears, and remove of thy Burdens. Doſt thou want quicknings, ſoftnings for the hardneſs of thy Heart: ſtrengthnings under thy weakneſs, fitneſs for thy Mercies and Duties, Patience under thy Sufferings, and Humility under thy Priviledges? Doſt thou want thankfulneſs for thy Mercies, clearing up of thy Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, Taſts of God's Love, and readineſs for Death, Judgment, and Eternity? Why, all this Chriſt hath in his own hand already; He is not to ſeek for theſe things when thou crieſt after them.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:48427:107"/>
               <p> Again, As he hath Power to help thee, and fulfill all the Promiſes of God to thee, ſo he hath Right and Authority too: He is the Angel of the Covenant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. He is ſent, deputed, and ſealed of God, to this very Work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. All the Promiſes upon that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption-agreement betwixt the Father and the Son, are made over to him, and put into his hand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Now all that Chriſt can do for the making good of his Father's Word, and benefitting his People, he will certainly perform, for he ever liveth to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and is entred into Heaven, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as their Advocate and Agent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt muſt needs fulfill his Promiſes, or elſe he would weaken the Encouragement of Souls to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and ſo overthrow all his own Deſign in, and by the Goſpel, which is, to bring Souls to believe in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Theſe are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> written that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Joh,</hi> 17. 21. <hi>That the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me, Joh.</hi> 10. 38. Now, if Chriſt fails of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, how would this diſcourage Souls from believing in him? who would truſt Chriſt, ſhould he not be faithful? and the Devil would be ſure to make the moſt of this Advantage, to prevent believing. Chriſt will make good his Word in his own time, way, and meaſure, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but not one jot or tittle of the Law, till all be fulfilled.</hi> All ſhall be fulfilled for Believers, and in them: and if Chriſt cannot permit one Jot of the Law to fall to the ground, ſurely, he will not ſuffer ſo choice a part of the Goſpel as the Promiſes are, to be unaccompliſhed. Again, as Chriſt will perform all the Promiſes, ſo eſpecially thoſe great ones, that concern the Grace and Glory of all that believe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. <hi>He will give grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and glory,</hi> &amp;c. If the Lord Jeſus upbraided the Phari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſees for tything Mint and Cummin, and omitting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:48427:107"/> weightier matters of the Law, ſurely he cannot neglect the greateſt of his Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>promiſes to his people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord Jeſus is faithful to the Truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; thus was <hi>Moſes, He was faithful in all God's Houſe,</hi> Numb. 12. 7. that is, as a Steward, he was juſt and honeſt in the diſcharge of that Truſt committed to him, concerning the Work and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of God; ſo 'tis taken, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 21. <hi>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant;</hi> Thou haſt been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in thy Stewardſhip in the uſe of thoſe things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thee; in this Senſe is Chriſt faithful alſo; in a perfect Diſcharge of that Truſt repoſed in him, and that both with reſpect to God his Father, and with reſpect to his People.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of that Truſt committed to him by the Father, God the Father hath entruſted him with the great Concerns of Redemption, Grace, and Glory, with that glorious Contrivance of ſaving fallen man, and bringing about the Recovery of loſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and therefore he calls him his Servant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 5. <hi>And now ſaith the Lord that formed me from the Womb to be his Servant, to bring</hi> Jacob <hi>again to him.</hi> It ſets forth Chriſt's Deſignation by the Father, to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorly Office, wherein God the Father calls him to great work, commits vaſt Concerns to him, about the gathering in of loſt Souls, and undertaking their Attonement, Sanctification, and Salvation; for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of which, the Father commits all to the Fidelity of Chriſt, both as to Suffering and interceding work, and in all this the Lord Jeſus is faithful: ſo the Spirit of God calls him a faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining unto God, in making Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Sins of the People. This the Lord Jeſus undertook to the Father, that he would ſatisfie his Wrath, and remove his Diſpleaſure from his People,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48427:108"/> by bearing their Sins for and from them, that God might again take them into his Favour, as if they had never ſinned; and in this he was and is faithful, nay in all things that God hath charged him with, about the ſaving of Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo Moſes was faithful in all his houſe.</hi> So that whatever the Father laid on Chriſt in the behalf of his people to make Reconciliation for them, and preſent them ſpotleſs in his Preſence, this he hath fully and faithfully diſcharged, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn on this Subject.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord Jeſus hath a Truſt committed to him from his People: They commit the keeping of their Souls to him as to a faithful Redeemer, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. Every believing Soul when he comes over to Chriſt firſt, doth depute, accept of, chuſe and entruſt the Lord Jeſus to be his Redeemer, and he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the preſerving of him unto Glory; he that comes to Chriſt aright, takes him for his Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. For ſo is Chriſt given and tendred by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo do Believers receive him, and entruſt him with their Souls, that they may be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, have their Sins remov'd, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the Father, without Spot or Wrinkle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. They truſt Chriſt for Sanctification, to be made truly, and in his time perfectly holy, as holy as God is holy, and as holy as God requires. They truſt Chriſt for Wiſdom, to be made Partakers of divine Light, to be made wiſe unto Salvation, to know all that God would have them, and that their Natures are capable to underſtand, and to have the Image of God perfected in them, which conſiſts in Knowledge as well as Righteouſneſs. They commit themſelves to Chriſt to be redeemed from every Evil,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48427:108"/> Sin, or Danger, or whatever hinders their compleat Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: thus do Believers, take Chriſt, and ſurrender themſelves up to him on theſe great and glorious ends, and thus did he undertake, when he gave himſelf by his Spirit to them, and therefore is called the Surety of the Covenant, as hath been already ſhewn, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. to 28. That Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Church, that he might waſh it and cleanſe it, ſanctifie it and preſent it to the Father without Spot or Wrinkle or any ſuch thing. This he undertook when he became a Mediator between God and them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. Now he is faithful in this alſo to all his Seed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23. He is faithful who hath promiſed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. He is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt to forgive them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and that he is able to keep that good thing I have committed to him againſt that day,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. O Souls, you that have committed your ſelves to Chriſt in Truth, know that he is faithful, and will not fail you, but will certainly accompliſh and make good all your regular Hopes and Expectations, he can looſe nothing of all that the Father hath given him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 12. Be ſure, what Bargain ſoever he hath made with you, what Mercies ſoever he hath promiſed you, he will aſſuredly fulfil and keep touch to a tittle; he is the faithful Steward, and Advocate for his People.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Lord Jeſus is faithful to all the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he ſtands in to his people; Herein Fidelity appears in holding forth, and living up to thoſe Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in which a perſon ſtands to others; ſo <hi>Sylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is called a faithful Brother, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 12. and <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> a faithful Miniſter, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 21. In this that they were true and juſt, in holding forth all the Duties of their Relation, Defectiveneſs, in which diſcovers Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Treachery: but the Lord Jeſus is faithful in all Relations to Believers; he fills them up, and anſwers
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48427:109"/> the end of them, now the Scripture ſets forth the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt to Believers, by ſeveral Relations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is their Friend, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 8. <hi>The ſeed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>my Friend, Joh.</hi> 15. 14. 15. <hi>Ye are my Friends, I have called you Friends,</hi> Joh. 11. 11. <hi>Our Friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Now Chriſt is a faithful Friend to his people in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth all the Offices of true Friendſhip to them. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Love, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>A friend loveth at all times,</hi> ſuch a Friend is Chriſt to all his, many Waters cannot quench it, he loves his People when he hides his Face from them, when he ſpeaks ſharply to them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely rebukes them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To own his Friend in all places, times, and conditions, ſo <hi>Jonathan</hi> owned <hi>David</hi> in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Dangers, when his Father ſought his Life, when it was dangerous to appear for him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 28. 32. ſo Chriſt is not aſham'd to own his People before God; men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before men him will I confeſs before my Father's Face,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 21. <hi>He reproved Kings for their ſake, ſaying, touch not mine anointed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Pity; <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Pity ſhould be ſhewn from a Friend.</hi> And in this is Chriſt faithful, he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the ignorant, and thoſe that are out of the way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 2. He cannot hide his Eyes from his own Fleſh; he is that good <hi>Samaritane, Luke</hi> 10. 33.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Counſel; <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>Oyntment and Perfume rejoyce the Heart, ſo doth the Sweetneſs of a man's Friend by hearty Counſel:</hi> Chriſt is called the <hi>Counſellor,</hi> Iſaiah 9. 6. <hi>He will guide his People with his Eye, and inſtruct them in the way they ſhould go,</hi> Pſal. 32. 8. <hi>Thou gaveſt thy good Spirit to inſtruct them,</hi> Neh. 9. 20.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Adherence; <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>There is a Friend, that ſticketh cloſer than a Brother,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 17. So the Lord Jeſus he ſtands by his People in time of need, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 91. 15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 44. 3.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:48427:109"/>
               <p> Sixthly, Comfort; So <hi>Joh</hi>'s Friends, <hi>Job.</hi> 2. 11. Came to mourn with him, and to comfort him, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is faithful in this alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14, 18. <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs,</hi> Iſa. 61. 2. <hi>To comfort all that mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, Communication of Secrets; <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>How canſt thou ſay thou loveſt me, when thy Heart is not with me?</hi> Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſuch a Friend, he will open the very Secrets of his heart to his People, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 15. <hi>I have called you Friends for all that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you, Pſal.</hi> 25. 14. O the ſecret Myſteries of the Goſpel, he diſcloſeth to his faithful People, that walk much with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Supply of wants, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>A Friend is born for Adverſity,</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpects to them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. A true friend is ready to impart any thing for his Friend; ſo <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſtript himſelf to his Girdle, and Bow, and Sword, for <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 4. Chriſt is ſuch a Friend as will ſupply, all the Neceſſities of his people, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need:</hi> Such a Friend he was to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 48. 15. <hi>The God which fed me all my Life long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He is faithful as a Brother, for in this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo doth he ſtand to his people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Go to my Brethren, and ſay to them, that I aſcend to my Father, and your Father, to my God and your God.</hi> Chriſt and Believers have all one Father, though in a different way, Chriſt the natural, Believers the adopted Children of God. Now as he ſtands to them in the Capacity and State of a Brother, an elder Brother, ſo his Fidelity conſiſts in a faithful Diſcharge of the Duties of ſuch a relation. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, One Duty is Love; All the Saints ſtand in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Brethren one to another, and ſo are obliged to mutual Love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 10. Chriſt fulfills this duty to his people, he loves them as himſelf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. perfectly with the ſame love with which the Father loves him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 9.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:48427:110"/>
               <p> Secondly; Another brotherly duty is Pity; 1 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Having Compaſſion one of another, love as Brethren, be pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> So Chriſt can truly ſay as <hi>Eſther</hi> did of her Kindred, <hi>Eſther</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Now can I endure to ſee the Evil that ſhall come unto my People, or how can I endure to ſee the Deſtruction of my Kindred?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Unity is the duty of Brethren, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 1. <hi>Behold how good and pleaſant is it for Brethren to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> ſo is the Lord Jeſus one with his people; This he dyed for, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 52. This he prays for, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another brotherly duty is Peace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>Let there be no ſtrife betwixt me and thee, and betwixt my Herdſmen and thy Herdſmen, for we be Brethren.</hi> So Chriſt labours after peace for his people, and with them, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16. 33.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Acknowledgment is another duty of Brethren, So Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>He is not aſham'd to call them brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, viſiting one another, and taking hold of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to enquire the welfare of each other, and communicate Refreſhments. Thus did <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 7. 23. He viſited his Brethren, and ſo doth Chriſt his People, he gives them ſpecial Acceſſes by his Spirit, he leaves them not comfortleſs, but will come unto them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As a husband to his Spouſe, is Chriſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 5. <hi>Thy Maker is thy Husband,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 19. 20. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me in Righteouſneſs, loving Kindneſs, and Faithfulneſs.</hi> Now Chriſt performs all the Offices of a tender Husband to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In loving them as himſelf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> Now I ſhall give you eight Proofs of Chriſt's great love, as a husband to his People.</p>
               <p>Firſt, His high Valuation of them, he eſteems them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the World beſides, nay above Heaven it ſelf; he could leave the Heaven of Heavens to ſeek after, and to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48427:110"/> ſave them, and Manſions of Glory to come down, and betroath them: he deſpiſed all the offer'd Pleaſures and Grandure of the world, when propoſed to divert his Love from them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. He ſets forth their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by terms of greateſt worth, he calls them his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 15. A Kingdom of Prieſts, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. His Jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Thy Cheeks are comely with Rows of Jewels, thy Neck with Chains of Gold.</hi> Cant. 2. 2. <hi>As the Lilly among Thorns, ſo is my Love among the Daughters:</hi> He terms them, <hi>a Fountain of Gardens, an Orchyard of Pomegranates,</hi> Cant. 4. <hi>The only one of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the choice one of her that bare her.</hi> Theſe high Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters the Lord Jeſus gives his Spouſe, ſhews the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful account he makes of her.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His coſtly purchaſe of them, he ſold himſelf to redeem them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. He parted with all his Glory, Treaſures, Peace, Pleaſures, Strength and Life to procure a people to himſelf; had not his love been infinitely great to all his Seed, he would never have bought them at ſo dear a rate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His great Endurings for them; <hi>Jacob</hi> tells us of ſome Hardſhips he underwent to gain <hi>Rachel, Gen.</hi> 31. 40. 41. But theſe are nothing to Chriſt's Endurings for his Spouſe: he bore infinite Torments for her, all the Wrath and Vengeance of a conſuming Fire, which all the Sins of Believers did merit; he bore temporal Troubles, Wants, Wearineſs, Pains, Shame, Death it ſelf, with whatever the damned in Hell bear to all Eternity, that did he endure, to get a Spouſe among the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Sons and Daughters of men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His amorous Treatments of them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Converſes with them; ſee the Exuberancy of his Affection, breathing out at his Lips to them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 1. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Behold thou art fair my Love, behold thou art fair, thou haſt Doves Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 7. <hi>Thou art all fair my</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, His large Gifts and dowry to them; he gives himſelf, his Spirit, his Purchaſe, his Laws, his Promiſes, his Love, Life, Light, and his Kingdom, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed, and this doth diſcover his large Affection to them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His impatient longing after them, ſhews the Greatneſs of his conjugal love to them; <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>O my Dove that art in the Clifts of the Rock, in ſecret places of the Stairs, let me ſee thy Countenance and hear thy Voice,</hi> Jer. 3. 14, <hi>Turn O back-ſliding Children, for I am marryed to you:</hi> He ſtands at the door, knocking with the dew of the night on his locks, ſaying, <hi>Open to me my Siſter, my Spouſe, my Love, my Dove, my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled, Cant.</hi> 5. 2. He is troubled when he cannot ſee them, and they will not come unto him, that he might give them life.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, His wonderful Complacency in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing over them, he is well pleaſed with; he reſts in his love over them, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17. He takes them for his only Portion, Seed, and Travel of his Soul, wherein he is ſatisfied: <hi>And as a Bridegroom rejoyceth over his Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee,</hi> Iſa. 62. 5. <hi>For the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in thee, and thy Land ſhall be marryed,</hi> ver. 4.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, His utter Inability to part with them, proves his great love to them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You muſt pluck out his Heart before you can make him conſent to let his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48427:111"/> Spouſe go, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>None ſhall pluck them out of my Hands.</hi> That's the firſt Teſtimony of his conjugal Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, his Love to all his people; 'tis a conſtant Love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Having loved his own that were in the World, he loved them to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, His Cohabitation with them; this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Husbands duty to his Spouſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Ye Husbands dwell with them according to Knowledge,</hi> ſuch is the Fidelity of Chriſt to his, that he takes up his abode with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. and walks with, and dwells among them, 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 6. 16. He doth not give them a tranſient Viſit, and look upon them now and then; however he may ſometimes appear a ſtranger, and draw a Curtain over the light of his Countenance; yet he doth not change his Habitation, but takes up his reſt in <hi>Sion,</hi> and dwells there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>He will never leave them nor forſake them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, his affectionate and intimate Converſes with them, proves his conjugal Fidelity; he keeps up Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them; Chriſt in Heaven maintains corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with his people on Earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 22. <hi>The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>municate my mind unto you, and concerning you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His tender Sympathy with them; <hi>In all their</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:48427:112"/> 
                  <hi>Afflictions he is afflicted,</hi> Iſaiah 63. 9. He ſoon feels their Troubles, he that toucheth them, toucheth the Apple of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ye; <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> Act. 9. 4. and therefore the Sufferings of the Saints are called the (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the after Sufferings of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. What is done to them he reckons as done to himſelf. And he doth not only feel their Afflictions, but bear their Burdens for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 22. <hi>Caſt thy burden on the Lord, he will ſuſtain thee;</hi> yea he helps and relieves them under all their Afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His patience towards them, ſhews his Fidelity as a husband; 'tis riches of patience and long-ſuffering that the Lord doth exerciſe towards his every day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His gracious Indulgence towards them, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their Imperfections, and pardoning their Offences is another thing his conjugal Relation to his People, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him to, and this he is faithful in; he puts Honour upon the uncomely parts and carriages of his People, by cloathing them with the covering of his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. He calls upon his people to put on their white Rayment, that the ſhame of their Nakedneſs do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: He puts up many a wrong for them, and paſſeth by many a weakneſs in them, concealing their Imperfections from the view of others, and all becauſe he loves them, and they are his <hi>Hephzibah</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly, His Care of them demonſtrates his conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Fidelity to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. His Eyes are always upon them, from one end of the year to the other, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Commit thy way to the Lord, truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs,</hi> Pſal. 37. 5. Upon him is the care of all the Churches, and of every Saint, yea of all their Concerns, even their very hairs. He cares for their Bodies, their Souls, their Families, their names, their Comfort, and their Profit: he will not leave them comfortleſs, nor ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are able, he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48427:112"/> will provide all things they ſtand in need of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 3. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 9. and if he withholds theſe lower things from them here, he prepares ſome better thing for them, both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Protection of them from their Evils and Dangers; this is a Husbands duty to be a covering for his Spouſe, and a Screen to her from Injury, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 16. So Chriſt he carries his as on Eagles Wings out of the reach of their deſtroying Adverſaries, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 4. <hi>Deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 33. 27. <hi>The eternal God is thy Refuge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath are everlaſting Arms. He will keep the Feet of his Saints,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 9. And be a little Sanctuary to them in all places.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, His cleaving to them for ever, and being one Felſh with them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>For the Lord will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake</hi> his people; he is a preſent help to them; in time of Trouble always with them, never unmindful of them and their guide unto death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 14. Yea in Death and to all Eternity, he will be their Life and Salvation; here death determines the Capacity of the moſt faithful huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but Chriſt will accompany his Spouſe, and be a Salvation in and beyond the Grave.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As a head is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt faithful to his people; That is, another Relation in which Chriſt ſtands to believers, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>He is the head of the Body, the Church,</hi> &amp;c. He is compleatly furniſhed with all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Fullneſs for that end, to be the head of his Body the Church, both as to natural and purchaſed grace; As God he is eternal, and ſo hath all ſufficiency in him; <hi>Before all things,</hi> and is their Maker and Preſerver, and as man, he is <hi>the firſt-born from the dead,</hi> and by his death hath purchaſed a Mediatorly Sufficiency to be the head of, and to preſide his Body, and perform all the Offices of Headſhip to it, as to Honour, Government, and Influence: And he hath not only a Fitneſs to be a head to his Church, but a Right too; for the Father hath given him to be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48427:113"/> the Head over all things to his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. Gave, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>conſtituit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zanchy,</hi> he appointed him and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed actually with him, and made him over to the Church, to the whole body of Believers, and to every ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to their uſe, intent, and purpoſe, that he ſhould be a Head to them, a true head, a perfect head, an only head, and an eternal head: Now in this Relation is Chriſt faithful alſo, anſwering the ends, filling up the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, and diſcharging the Offices of it. Now in this headſhip of Chriſt are ſix things wrapt up.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Counſel and Wiſdom; In him are all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wiſdom, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. All that Light and Knowledge which is needful to make his people wiſe to Salvation; all that Wiſdom which is requiſite to repair the loſt Image of man, and all that Wiſdom which may render him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding excellent, and glorious; for in him is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Knowledge, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. And all this Counſel he ſtands engag'd to impart to his people, as they are able to bear it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>Wherein he hath abounded towards us in all Wiſdom and Prudence. Wherein,</hi> that is, <hi>Qua gratia;</hi> By which Grace, ſaith <hi>Zanchy, He hath abounded towards us;</hi> that is, hath made us to abound in. So the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> and <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> He hath plentifully imparted to us; hence 'tis enſured to all that truly ſeek it of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. He will tell them what to do in all caſes, as Chriſt did to <hi>Cornelius</hi> by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Acts</hi> 10. 6. He hath all Wiſdom in him, the ſtone on which is ſeaven Eyes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 9. and will be in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Difficulty and Danger with them. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid to</hi> Hobab, <hi>we are to encamp in the Wilderneſs, but thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be unto us inſtead of Eyes,</hi> Numb. 10. 23. So he hath engaged to guide them continually, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 33. He is as Eyes to them, where they are in a Land of Pits and Deſarts, to guide them in the Wilderneſs Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, while they are ſearching out the Land of Glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Care; His Eyes and his Heart are on them continually, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7. 16. He is meaſuring <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48427:113"/> ſee what is the Length thereof, and what is the breadth thereof, that ſhe may be built, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conduct is the Office of a Head; It ought to lead and diſpoſe of the body and all it's Members to their ſeveral Offices. So the Lord Jeſus is given to his Church, for their Leader as well as Commander, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 48. 17. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way thou ſhould'ſt go.</hi> 'Tis in the Original, making or cauſing thee to walk; he doth not only ſhew them the way, but leads them by the hand, and helps them to go, as, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 12. <hi>So the Lord alone did lead them.</hi> Chriſt undertakes to conduct his people thorough the World unto Glory.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Government is another act of Headſhip, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Their King ſhall paſs before them, and the Lord on the head of them:</hi> that is, The Lord ſhall be their Governour and General, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6, 7. <hi>The Government is upon his Shoulders,</hi> Heb. 3. 16. He is the Son over his houſe, to rule and govern it, and this he doth, by making righteous and perfect Laws, and Rules, thereby to govern his Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. And by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and ſubduing the Hearts and Wills of his people unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Influence; This comes from the Head; all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Influence for Subſiſtence, Motion, guiding and action come from thence; in the Head are all the Senſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals exerted for the uſe and Service of the Body, ſo is the Lord Jeſus the head of all vital Influences, to the whole Church and every part of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 7. <hi>All my Springs are in thee,</hi> Joh. 15. 4. <hi>As the Branch cannot beare Fruit, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me,</hi> Col. 3. 3, 4. chap. 2. 19. Believers can no longer live, than Chriſt becomes a quickning Spirit to them; he alone animates their Souls to every good work, anoints their Eyes, and cauſeth them to ſee, regulates their Palate, and maketh them to taſt the Sweetneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48427:114"/> things, open their Ears to diſcipline, cauſeth them to feel the Weightineſs of Sin, and to ſmell a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in his precious Oyntments.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Ornament; The head is the beauty of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if that be removed, the Body is but a deformed lump; Chriſt is the Believers Excellency and Glory, he hath the preheminence in all things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. And his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the Glory of the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 24. All the Saints Excellencies are in and from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 34. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 17. <hi>For thou art the Glory of their Strength,</hi> 'tis through his Comelineſs they are perfect, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. to 14.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is faithful in the acts of diſtributive Juſtice, and renders to every one their Due, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Thou rendereſt to ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But Evangelically all the Believers Rights are due on the account of Chriſt. So that all what Chriſt hath purchaſed, or the Father promiſed to Chriſt, is due to his Seed; ſo that Mercy, Grace, and Glory is as much the Believers due, as Death and Vengeance is the Sinners, on the ſcore of his Sin, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 6. 7. Therefore the Juſtice of Chriſt is laid to pawn for the pardon of Believers Sins, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their penitential Confeſſion, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. This is the great Error of troubled Souls, that they make their Worthyneſs or Unworthyneſs the Standard and Meaſure of all their Expectations; this is the Impotency the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated Law of God hath left on fallen man, that they cannot get over <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> nor ſee the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, and the Equity of Salvation upon his account; for their Sins and Unrighteouſneſſes do ſo hang in their Eye, that they cannot ſee themſelves righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the Righteouſneſs of another; This Tang of a legal Spirit is a malady-Grace, is long a curing in Saints
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48427:114"/> themſelves; the want of which robs Chriſt of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Grace and Righteouſneſs: But know O Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Lord Jeſus would be unfaithful if he render not to thoſe that live on him for Sanctification and Salvation all that he hath promiſed in the Goſpel, and hath dyed to purchaſe for them; but this cannot be as you have heard abundantly, that the Lord Jeſus is faithful in acts of Remuneration; he cannot keep back anothers due, who would have all men to render to others their due: But all that God hath made over in the new Covenant to Believers, is their due, and therefore will Chriſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in it's ſeaſon. And thus have I opened and proved this glorious Excellency of the Lord Jeſus, even his Faithfulneſs; it remains now, that we make ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. How great then is the Sin of all thoſe that will not credit the Faithfulneſs of Chriſt; there are none that periſh under the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, but ſtumble at this ſtumbling block; they do not judge God faithful, nor believe the report given of Chriſt, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. 1. Though Chriſt be manifeſtly held forth to be a perfect Saviour, yet few will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; not one of a hundred (ſays <hi>Calvin)</hi> that hear Chriſt dayly will yet believe in him: you know it Sinners, you may ſafely adventure your Souls on Chriſt, he cannot lye or fail you: you have the whole word of God for your Aſſurance, all the Scriptures teſtifie of him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 28. You have the Evidences of Chriſt's Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his ſtate of Humiliation, he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd all things written of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 31. He fulfill'd all Righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 15. His Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, prove him faithful in all things tending to purchaſe Salvation. You have the Teſtimony of others, who have found Chriſt faithful, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 2. All the Saints on
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48427:115"/> record are witneſſes of Chriſt's Fidelity. Nay, you your ſelves have found him faithful hitherto; how often hath he made good his Promiſes to you, when you have called upon him, and truſted in him for outward Mercies. You truſt other things that are unfaithful, and yet will not believe in Chriſt: You truſt your own Hearts, and they are deceitful, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. You truſt in men, and yet they are a lye, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. You truſt in Creatures, and yet they are vanity, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2. You know, without Faith you muſt periſh to all Eternity, and yet will not believe in him.</p>

So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 11. <hi>Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, or elſe believe me for the Works ſake.</hi> O the Queſtions and Doubts that Souls have about the fulfilling of Promiſes! how loth they are to truſt Chriſt further than they ſee him.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48427:115"/> to your Children, Servants, and Neighbours; how little have you done for theſe to this day? Some of you are Parents; and Maſters, but where hath been your Induſtry in your Families, in teaching, reproving, and labouring to ſave the Souls of thoſe committed to you? The Lord lay not the neglect of this to your Charge, nor being in the Blood of your ignorant, prophane, periſhing Families, Children or Servants, on your head.

Who can hear their Children and Servants ſwear, take God's Reverend Name in vain, and ſee them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Sabbaths, and ſpend Sacred time in Debauchery and Idleneſs, and ſcarce ever check them; that can ſuffer them to lye in Ignorance, and ready to periſh for want of Knowledge, and never labour to catechize and inſtruct them in the knowledge of Salvation: This is a lamentable caſe, and will appear ſo, when theſe Parents and Maſters ſhall appear before God, with their garments all gor'd and ſtain'd with the blood of their Families.

               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing that Chriſt is become a Purchaſer in the behalf of Believers; How he hath made this Purchaſe, and what he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Now come to the Second Branch of Chriſts Unſearchable Treaſure, which is his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd Riches: Thoſe Treaſures which he hath as Mediatour procured for all that come unto him. And in the proſecution of this, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Lord Jeſus became a Purchaſer in the behalf of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How and by what means he made this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, The Scriptures do hold forth the Lord Jeſus to be a Purchaſer: One that hath bought and procured great and glorious things by a Price. <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Feed the Flock of God which he hath Purchaſed with his own blood:</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) 'Tis
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48427:117"/> exceeding ſignificant in the Originall, both words being near of a ſignification, until or to the purchaſing of the purchas'd, ſo 'tis in the words; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies a Buying or ranſoming by a price, yea a full ſum, ſo much as the worth of the thing requires: As priſoners are redeemed by a full price: So <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Aretius.</hi> It ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies alſo a full and compleat Redemption, as the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) as I have ſhewn is an obtaining by purchaſe, or an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or vindicating a thing to be ones Propriety by right and purchaſe, which fully proves Chriſt to be a Purchaſer, ſo 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>To obtain Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to the getting or purchaſing of Salvation by Chriſt. So 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Ye are bought with a Price.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) The word is a buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Market or publick place, by paying the price demanded. So that theſe expreſſions fully Prove Chriſt to be a Purchaſer, one that hath procured great things by buying them at a Price.</p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>How and by what means hath Chriſt procured and purchaſed theſe great things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt; By giving himſelf in the room and ſtead of fallen Man, to procure their Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Salvation. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>As Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it:</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) He delivered over himſelf freely, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. To what? See <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>For an Offering and Sacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) The firſt word ſignifies any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the ſecond a bloody Sacrifice, ſaies <hi>Zanchy:</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:48427:117"/> So Chriſt made over and delivered up himſelf to this end to become a bloody Sacrifice for his People, and to fulfil the Fathers Terms for the ſaving of all that come to him. This he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately and willingly: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. This was according to the agreement betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>to</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly; By a perfect and perpetual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of all thoſe Laws that were or are required of us in order to our holineſſe and Salvation, and by a ſubjection to, and Obedience of the ſpecial Law of a Mediatour: This hath two parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt; His Obedience of what was required of Man by any Law: By the Law of Nature, or by any Inſtituted Law, either Moral, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, or Judicial: All this did Chriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to and perfectly obey as in the ſtead of all Believers; <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>It became him to fulfill all Righteouſneſſe.</hi> Whatever holineſſe or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was required of Man in the ſtate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, or ſince his fall. And therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. He was made under the Law, as a Man or Miniſter, bound by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the full Obedience of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly; His obeying all thoſe things that were required of him as Mediatour, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. That he ſhould make himſelf poor, and of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and take upon him the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) He emptyed himſelf of his Glory: He ſtript himſelf of all his royal robes, and made himſelf of no account. This was not required by any Law natural or poſitive, but by the Law of a Mediatour. Again he humbled
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48427:118"/> himſelf to the death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. He had power or liberty, abſolutely conſidered, to lay down his life or not to do it; but with reſpect to his Mediatorſhip he had a Commandement to lay it down, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18. Further, 'Twas by this Law Chriſt was bound to do all that he did for his People. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 19. <hi>Only for their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelf.</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the World.</hi> So he was not to ſtrive or open his mouth, but patiently to bear what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was laid upon him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 19. And by this Obedience of Chriſt are believers made righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. For this is neceſſary to Salvation, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements be kept, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 17. And the Law fulfilled, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; By his ſuffering all things we were liable to by the firſt tranſgreſſion, or any actual Sins flowing from it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. This he did in all the ſufferings of his Life; and at his death, he bore the ſins of believers for them, 1. <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 24. <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions. Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. And became a Sacrifice to God for Sin. <hi>Iſa</hi> 53. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. The end of which was atonement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. He alſo paid the price that God demanded for their deliverance. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſom for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, By his Interceſſion Chriſt compleats his Purchaſe, and carries on the ſalvation of his people. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather is riſen again, who is alſo at the right hand of God and maketh Interceſſion for us.</hi> Though by this he doth not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48427:118"/> purchaſe for his people, yet he doth procure and apply mercy to them: As I have largely ſhewn already, therefore ſhall wave it now.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>What are thoſe great and glorious things which J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſus Chriſt hath procured by his blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, He hath purchaſed Believers themſelves unto God. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Feed the Flock of God which he hath purchaſed with his blood.</hi> Rev. 5. 9. <hi>For thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us unto God by thy blood.</hi> Every ſaved ſoul is part of Chriſts purchaſe: They are ſet apart for God. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 4. 3. A peculiar People to God. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Though the Father hath ordained them to life, yet they are not actually his till purchas'd by Chriſt. Hence it is that Believers Converſion, is not caſual or dependent upon Men or means, but is the effect and fruit of Chriſt's blood pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned, and unavoidably perfected by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption-grace: And hence alſo their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſure, being founded on the purchaſe of Chriſt. As ſure as Chriſts blood cannot be ſpilt in vain, ſo ſure ſhall every Believer have his Salvation perfected, becauſe it depends upon the Obedience, Merit, and Suffering of Chriſt. Hence alſo all the Means of Salvation and the Efficacy of them are certain to believers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly; He hath Purchaſed pardon of Sin, and peace with God. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Having made peace by the blood of his Croſſe: Chap.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. There is a full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, of all the ſins of believers, and of every believers, purchaſed by the blood of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48427:119"/> Chriſt. Here are four things I ſhall ſpeak to.</p>
               <p>Firſt; That there is a full Pardon of ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; The Scripture ſets this forth by clear and pregnant arguments, and by ſeveral terms that leave no room for the leaſt Suſpition to the believing Soul. 'Tis called ſometimes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. <hi>And that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name:</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) it ſignifies Diſmiſſion or Releaſing. All unchanged Souls are in Debt to God, bound over to wrath, and laid up in Priſon, but by Jeſus Chriſt there is a diſcharge of this Debt procured, the bond Cancell'd, the Priſon opened, and the Sinners ſet free, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1.</p>
               <p>Sometimes 'tis call'd not imputing ſin, not laying it to the ſinners charge, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32. 1, 2. <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth not iniquity;</hi> that is, doth not charge, and reckon it, and lay it on his account: As a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that ſends his Bill to his Debtour, and charges ſeveral ſums upon him: 'Tis true every Believer is a Debtor in himſelf, but God charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Debt on another, and not on them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes 'tis termed a covering or hiding of ſin, not from the ſinners, but from Gods judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Eye; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 2. <hi>Thou haſt forgiven the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy people, thou haſt covered all their ſin.</hi> Pſal. 78. 38. <hi>He being full of compaſſion forgave their iniquity. [Caphar]</hi> to cover or conceal; from this Root is derived <hi>Caphoreth,</hi> the covering of the Ark or Mercy-ſeat, in which was the Law or knowledge of ſin, but by the blood of Chriſt was covered or purged away.</p>
               <p>Sometimes 'tis expreſſed by not remembring
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48427:119"/> ſin any more; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>I will remember their ſin no more:</hi> I will be propitiouſly merciful, or pacifiedly favourable to their ſins, and their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful errours and unrighteouſneſs will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber no more; or I will not remember them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Here are two Negatives which make the denyal the more vehement. 'Tis an alluſion to men that forgive and forget, and it ſignifies that God will not upbraid or reproach them with them any more: hence <hi>Paul</hi> challengeth all the world to lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33.</p>
               <p>Further, 'tis ſet forth by a taking away of ſin; <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7. <hi>Forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> The word in the Original is, lifting up or taking away all ſorts of ſins and iniquities.</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis ſignified by blotting out of ſin, ſo that it ſhall never be ſeen more; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 25. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions:</hi> Like the Merchant when the debt is paid croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Book, throws Ink on it, blots it out, that it may not be read any more; ſo God the Father caſts the blood of Chriſt on a Believer's ſin, and blots it out, ſo that Juſtice can lay no more to their charge.</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis called a caſting of ſin behind his back, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 17. He doth remove them out of his ſight as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103. 12. He will caſt all their ſins into the depth of the Sea, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18, 19. O the latitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers pardon, and the full diſcharge of all their ſin! Sometimes God ſeems to be throwing off his people, and giving them a final farewel; but, oh! he returns again, and caſteth their ſins,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48427:120"/> (not them,) into the depth of the Sea, where they ſhall be certainly drowned as the <hi>Egyptian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> were, never to be ſeen more.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee there's a full pardon procured for God's people, not the leaſt ground for a Queſtion left to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is not only a full pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, but a pardon of every ſin. All the ſins of Gods people are forgiven: <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. 14. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forgiven you all treſpaſſes, blotting out the handwriting:</hi> that not one debt may be ſeen; as a Book or Bill that is blotted out can be never more ſued againſt one: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin. Jer.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>The iniquity of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be nove; and the ſins of</hi> Judah, <hi>and they ſhall not be found, for I will pardon them whom I reſerve:</hi> The moſt cruel Enemy upon the ſtricteſt ſearch ſhall not find one; they ſhall be all forgiven: And indeed if Grace be free, there is the ſame reaſon why all ſhall be pardoned as well as one: And if the grace of God bring ſalvation then all muſt be forgiven or none: And the ſame blood of Chriſt can as well pardon all as one. For if the blood of Chriſt be the blood of God, then 'tis of an infinite value, and can as eaſily blot out every ſin as one ſin; and as well diſcharge Talents as Pence. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 22. <hi>Larga Dei pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas veniam non dimidiabit. Aut nihil aut to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum dabit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, This pardon of ſin is procured for repenting Believers, and for all of them: <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:48427:120"/> 
                  <hi>remiſſion of ſins: Acts</hi> 13. 38. <hi>chap.</hi> 26. 18. Faith is neceſſary to pardon, becauſe it takes off all ſelf-righteouſneſs, and all pretences of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

                  </gap>ſneſs and ſalvation. Faith is a ſelf-denying Grace, and expects all upon the account of the Promiſe. Believers, and every Believer, have their ſins pardoned, and ſhall not periſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. Now leſt ſome ſhould pretend to believe, who indeed do not, the Seripture qualifies this Faith by certain Characters. 'Tis alſo to repenting ſouls that pardon is aſſured, and therefore remiſſion of ſin is joined with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 46, 47. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30. But what is this repentance? Doth it conſiſt only in an external ſorrow for ſin, and an audible begging of mercy? No, no, <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> were thus troubled for ſin, and yet never arrived to ſound repentance: 'Tis the mourning and returning believer to whom this Promiſe is made: and to ſuch, and to every one of theſe is a full pardon procured.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This pardon is procured by the blood of Chriſt, and that ſatisfaction made to the Father by his ſuffering. It is an Opinion ſprung up of men of corrupt minds, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin is the procurement of Inherent grace, and external Righteouſneſs, but not the product of Chriſt's blood, ſuffering and ſatisfaction, which I ſhall now endeavour to diſprove, <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>To give his Life a Ranſome for many.</hi> Heb. 9. 26. <hi>But now once in the end of the World hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf, chap.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14. Thus you ſee 'tis the blood of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48427:121"/> Chriſt offer'd up to God, that procureth peace, and removeth the guilt of ſin: and indeed pardon of ſin with reſpect to Gods Juſtice could be no otherway obtain'd. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, God had paſt an irrevocable ſentence, that the Soul that ſinneth ſhould dye, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. Now if this penalty was not inflicted upon Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing <hi>Adam;</hi> how would there be a fulfilling of this threatning. But ſome may enquire, How comes <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to be charg'd on his Poſterity? <hi>Anſw. Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion, by the ſtrict union there was betwixt him and all mankind, (he being their Head, Root, and Repreſentee) was moſt juſtly devolv'd on his Off-ſpring, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14, 19. And therefore God would not have been true to his word, had not this penalty been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the Debtor, or his Surety: But let God be true, and every Man a lyar.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Fallen Man could not pay this debt, and make this ſatisfaction for ſin: For the ſin being of an infinite Guilt, and the puniſhment being Death Eternal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Man could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pay his ranſom, and ſet himſelf at liberty, and therefore ſome other way muſt be found out, which was only by the Lord Jeſus, God-Man, whoſe God-head was able to ſupport his humane Nature under ſuffering, and render his endurings of an Infinite value, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. This is the ſecond Fruit of Chriſt's Purchaſe; the forgiveneſs of all the ſins of penitent belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, even paſt, preſent, and to come, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be laid to their charge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Acceptation of their Perſons is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruit of Chriſt's purchaſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Where</hi>

                  <hi>in he hath made us accepted in the beloved:</hi> 'Tis not enough to the compleating of Chriſts deſign in ſaving Souls, that their ſins be forgiven, and the guilt and penalty removed, and a diſcharge of all the Obligations to wrath by reaſon of ſin procured. All this a perſon may have, and yet no intereſt in the full favour of God, nor right to any ſaving bleſſing from him; for 'tis not ſufficient to give a Man a Title to Glory, that he be innocent, or free from offending, but he muſt come up to the terms of the firſt Covenant, and do all things required of him; and have a Poſitive as well as a Negative Righteouſneſs: <hi>There muſt be in order to an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, not only a not imputing of ſin, but a reckoning of Righteouſneſs</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Owen);</hi> he muſt be reputed fully Obedient alſo.

               <p>Firſt, That God never puniſhes them in wrath and diſpleaſure.

               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:48427:122"/>
               <p> Fifthly, Sin ſhall never more have dominion over them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, God will withhold no good thing from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. No temporal bleſſing, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 33. No ſpiritual bleſſing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.

Nay all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They can never forfeit their ſtate of Grace, and intereſt in the Favour of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. They ſhall be ſure to be kept by the mighty power of God unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. There is not the leaſt room left for a falling off from Grace: Becauſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Salvation is purchaſed for them; and if the end be purchaſed, then all the means to the end; and God in Juſtice is bound to make good Chriſts purchaſe, and to deliver what he bought and paid for, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Preſervation in grace is ingaged to them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23, 24. <hi>The very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly; and I pray God your whole Spirit, Soul, and Body be preſerved blameleſſe unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Faithful is he that calleth you, who alſo will do it</hi> Here we may ſee both Sanctification and Salvation is ſecured to all that are ſavingly called of God. Salvation is the End, and ſanctification is the Means, and both are ſounded not on the will of Man, or on his care and fidelity, but as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the act and faithfulneſſe of God; not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48427:123"/> only the firſt Act of Sanctification, but Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; continuance, and growth in Grace is the work of God, and it's perſeverance is laid upon divine preſervation; to which God hath bound himſelf by promiſe to every Soul that is truly ſanctified, and his Faithfulneſs is engag'd to make it good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are put into the Hands of Chriſt on purpoſe to be ſecured in Grace to Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28, 29. <hi>They ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand:</hi> They are engraven on the palms of his hands; their walls are continually before him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 16. Their Walls, that is their ſafety: This was ſpoken in a time when the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down: Yet at that time God had Walls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them to ſecure them, which they ſaw not. Both Believers themſelves, their Graces, and all the Promiſes are put into the hands of Chriſt, hence they cannot fall away.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, True Grace is of an abiding nature, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, for his ſeed abideth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi>

                  <hi>not at conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am &amp; penitiſſimam inhaeſionem,</hi> (ſaith one) 'Tis an abiding, and conſtant inheſion of Grace. Some to evade the evidence of this Truth, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſenſe of it, taking it for the new Creature which is born of God; whereas the Original is clear againſt it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Maſculine Gender, which notes a perſon, not a thing. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it would be a <hi>Tautologie</hi> to add a reaſon why ſuch a one cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God, and his ſeed remaineth in him, whereas the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48427:123"/> new Creature, and the ſeed of God are all one, but here they note two things; Firſt, A Perſon; Secondly, The Regenerate part of the Perſon; which is fully explain'd in the following <hi>ver.</hi> where he that is born of God, or the Child of God, is oppoſed to the Child of the Devil, which is meant of a diſtinct Perſon, not a different Nature in the ſame Perſon; and this ſeed of God is of an abiding nature wherever it comes, it comes never wholly to depart more, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Becauſe their Life is hid in Chriſt, and therefore cannot be loſt and periſh at their pleaſure, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3, 4. The Believers Grace is ſure in the Root, however it be in the Branch, and therefore Chriſt engages to his people, that they ſhall live becauſe he lives, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They have an Inſeparable union with the Spirit of Grace that dwells in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>He that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> Where the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, ever notes the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, not his Graces; ſo that the Saints have an abiding union with the Spirit of God the third Perſon, and ſo cannot periſh for want of Grace, but are kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation. He can never want Water that may have acceſs to the Fountain or Ocean; nor can any Soul be deſtitute of Grace that is united to the Spirit of Grace. The Graces of Saints are ſure; their Faith, their Preſervation is ſure: O what a glorious priviledge is this that flows to Believers, from this purchaſe of Chriſt, that their Salvation is ſure, and they may know it to be ſo.</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, That the Lord Jeſus hath purchaſed the ſanctification of the Natures and Perſons of his people. This I ſhall prove by ſeveral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, All the Types under the Law do imply ſo much, and darkly open this great truth to Believers. We find that Chriſt in the non-age and Infant ſtate of his Church and People dealt with them in Figures and Shadows: So the Laver, and Sacrifices, the Prieſts pure and white Robes and Veſtments, and the waſhing of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they were to approach the Divine Majeſty, were Typical of this Holineſs, which he was to procure for his people in the fullneſs of time, ſo much the Apoſtle imports, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is of Chriſt.</hi> The ſhadow goes before, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48427:124"/> the body follows: Theſe Types are precedaneous to the coming of Chriſt, and his full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the things intended, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them, thus Chriſt is the Altar that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the gift; <hi>In him we have thoſe true and ſolid good things which were ſhadowed out in thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies under the Law,</hi> (ſaies <hi>Daven.</hi> on the place)</p>
               <p>Secondly; The Names and Titles given to Chriſt import ſo much: <hi>He is called Jeſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhall ſave his People from their ſins: Mat.</hi> 1. 21. He is called a Redeemer to deliver them from their Bondages and hard Service: He is termed the Sanctifier: For he that Sanctifieth, and they that are Sanctifyed are all of one. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; For this end, he was actually deſigned of God, and made over to his People in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant, decrees, purpoſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of God. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>He is made of God unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Redemption.</hi> He is made of God: <hi>Non in creatione, ſed in ordinatione</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paraeus).</hi> Not created ſo according to his Divine Eſſence, as ſome Hereticks aſſert, but ordained and given of God to this end to be Sanctification, that is the Author of Sanctification, and therefore he is ſaid to ſave to the uttermoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. which can never be accompliſh'd without Holineſſe; <hi>For without holineſſe no man can ſee the Lord, Heb.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For this work was the Lord Jeſus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the Father to come unto <hi>Sion,</hi> and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ungodlineſs from <hi>Jacob. Rom.</hi> 11. 26. This Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is quoted out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. from which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle varies, following the Septuagint Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48427:125"/> (then in great uſe) rather than the <hi>Hebr.</hi> ſeeing it retaines t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſenſe, though different in words: In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 'tis <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come to</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto them that turn from Tranſgreſſion:</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaies, <hi>He ſhall come out of</hi> Sion, <hi>and turn away ungodlineſſe from</hi> Jacob: To reconcile which, <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> thinks the Septuagint might mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake <hi>(Laſhub) To turn,</hi> for <hi>(Leſhabe) To them that turn:</hi> But this is not likely that thoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctors could be ſo miſtaken in the Original, and therefore 'tis a far better anſwer that <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Grynaeus</hi> do give, That the Prophet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Effect of Chriſts coming; which is a turning away from Sin: And that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Cauſe of their turning from Sin; which is Chriſts taking away of Sin, for none can turn from ſin, till Chriſt do remove Sin: And this is the end of his coming into the World: To this end he is promiſed: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>He ſhall ſit as refiners fire, and purify the Sons of</hi> Levi. The Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> are, Firſtly meant of the Apoſtles: Secondly, I ſuppoſe, of all the Saints: But ſo much is clear, that the Lord Jeſus is promiſed to be a refiner to his People in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel times and to purge away their filth and droſs, and to make them Holy.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; For this end it was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf up to Redemption-work. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. <hi>As Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it; that he might Sanctify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water by the word:</hi> Here we have; 1. One great end of Chriſts O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Suffering; 'tis to make his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Holy. 2. Here's the efficient Cauſe of this Holineſſe, that is, By the Spirit of Chriſt; The
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48427:125"/> blood of Chriſt purges away the guilt of ſin Meritoriouſly, and the Spirit of Chriſt purifies the filth of ſin Efficiently; ſignifyed by Water, as 'tis often us'd in Scripture. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 38, 39. 3. Here's the inſtrumental cauſe of this Holineſſe, the means by which it is wrought and carryed on, and that is <hi>by the word,</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſeed of the Soul: This he undertook, and was intended to do in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption betwixt the Father and him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>He ſhall not fail till he hath ſet Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Earth,</hi> that is Holineſs; for ſo 'tis taken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. And this work is the Lord Jeſus here engag'd to do. Some take the word <hi>(Ethmoch) I uphold,</hi> paſſively for the Fathers dependence, and Chriſts Faithfulneſſe: He leans or ſtays upon his undertaking this work, and truſts to his performance of what he undertook to do: Others take it actively for the Fathers upholding and carrying Chriſt through this great work of Redemption, and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In both ſenſes 'tis true, The Lord Jeſus ſtands engaged to carry on Redemption-work, and is throughly furniſhed with grace to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. Chriſt readily conſents to the fulfilling of the Fathers will; and what that was you have <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 7. To open the blind eyes, and to bring out the Priſoners out of the Priſon, which is meant of the work of Redemption, and Regeneration; and it was the will of God the Father that Chriſt ſhould do this, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>This is the will of God even your Sanctification:</hi> And this he ſtood bound to do, to promote and perfect the power of Holineſſe in all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48427:126"/> Now what Chriſt did undertake he finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meritoriouſly, whiles on Earth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work thou haſt given me to do:</hi> And for the application of it, he is in Heaven to ſee it perform'd; and this is the work of his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> This Chriſt Intercedes for in Heaven, and therefore 'tis the fruit of his Purchaſe; for he Intercedes for no more in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven than what he dyed for on Earth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly; His Authoritative ſending the Spirit of Holineſſe to his people, ſhews his right to it by his Purchaſe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>I will ſend him to you.</hi> That is after the finiſhing of his work, and re-inſtalment in Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39. For the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe Chriſt was not yet glorifyed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly; Were not holineſſe purchaſed for ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls, Chriſts Redemption-work would be imperfect, neither could Souls ever anſwer the ends for which he dyed. Without Holineſſe were procured and compleated by Chriſt, there could be no Salvation. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt; Man cannot Sanctify himſelf; <hi>We are all as an unclean thing and our Righteouſneſſe as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rags,</hi> Iſa. 64. 6. <hi>And who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? no not one,</hi> Job 14. 4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Scripture ſometimes ſpeaks after this manner, <hi>Make you a clean heart,</hi> Ezek. 18. 31. <hi>Make you a new heart.</hi> So Iſa. 1. 16. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye celan:</hi> But there is Mans Duty not his power: It ſhews the ſubject, not the Author or this holineſſe; and where you find ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, they are to lead men to Chriſt for the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48427:126"/> getting of this Holineſs wrought in them; as, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>To whom come, as as to a living ſtone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Without this holineſs be wrought in Believers they can never be capable of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the ends of Redemption; which are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To enjoy Union and Fellowſhip with God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 52. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. Now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Holineſs no Fellowſhip with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16. For his Perſon is Holy; and his offerings and ſervices are Holy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To reconcile together in one all things in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. But no Fellowſhip with Angels or Saints in Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs for they are holy Creatures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To be brought into the neareſt U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Conformity to himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 5. But without Holineſs this cannot be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To be a Name and a praiſe unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 12. But without Holineſs no glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, To bring Souls to the poſſeſſion of the purchaſed Inheritance in Glory, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. But nothing that defileth ſhall enter within the Gate of the new <hi>Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21. 27. So much for the firſt Head, That Jeſus Chriſt hath Purchaſed Holineſſe. We ſhall now enquire,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>For whom hath the Lord Jeſus Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Holineſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For all his feed; for every Soul the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. Chriſts Purchaſe, death, and Interceſſion is only for thoſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given him, and every one of them, for all his ſeed that belong to him as the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> And in this ſenſe is that Scripture to be
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48427:127"/> taken: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>As by the offence of one Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all Men to Condemnation, even ſo by the Righteouſneſſe of one the free gift came upon all Men to Juſtification of life.</hi> That is; As death came by <hi>Adams</hi> fall to all his ſeed, ſo life comes by Chriſt to all his ſeed; neither can it be ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further, as the Apoſtle affirms, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, but he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> Neither will any affirm, that all Men are juſtified unto life, nor any but thoſe that believe in Chriſt, which are his ſeed: The Lord Jeſus tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20; 'Tis for all them that believe on him through his word. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>That the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them that believe:</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks here of a double Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and through him to Believing Gentiles. 1. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Righteouſneſſe in Juſtification, ver. 18, 19. 2. The Promiſe of the Spirit in Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ver. 14. <hi>That we might receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through Faith,</hi> and both theſe are made over to Believers. You that come to Chriſt in truth, and receive him into your hearts by faith, and take his Yoke on your ſhoulders, obey his Laws, ſincerely give up your all to him, and are no more your own, but though you ſee your want of Holineſſe, yet are really willing to be Holy as God is Holy, ſubmitting to all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of Chriſt, in order to it; you are the ſeed of Chriſt, the people to whom the Promiſe of Holineſſe doth belong.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>What is the Holineſſe Chriſt hath Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd for his People?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw,</hi> Firſt; The truth of Grace, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48427:127"/> to Hypocriſie: The Lord Jeſus never ſhed his blood for counterfeit grace. His purchas'd Treaſure conſiſts not of Counters, but tryed Gold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. What he offers to Sinners, that he purchaſed and dyed for; but Chriſt offers try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gold to invited Souls. Any thing ſhort of ſaving grace is not worth the ſhedding of the blood of the Son of God. That which Chriſt Promiſeth to his people is the ſame with that he hath purchaſed; but he promiſeth true grace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. He Promiſeth a new heart, and a new heart is a truly ſanctified heart: 'Tis his Spirit he will put within them; and his Spirit is a Spirit of truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 17. There is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Soul whoſe heart is made willing to be the Lords; but Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for him; Chriſt never dyed for Lies and Untruths, but ſeeming grace is a lye and not of the truth. This is wonderful comfort to poor troubled Souls that are always doubting of the truth of their graces, and would give a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds to be ſure that their gold is tryed gold, and their graces true graces. Now if ever thy Soul were brought to deſire Chriſt in truth, and to receive him with a lively Faith, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be ſure thy graces are true, becauſe the Lord Jeſus hath purchas'd this for all Believers. Now this truth of Grace conſiſts in a through change of the Soul, even of the whole Man; which may be diſtinguiſhed into theſe two parts. 1. The taking away of Sin. 2. The giving of Grace, the delivering the Soul from the power of Satan, and the reducing it under the power of God, and into his Kingdom: The purging the Soul from
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48427:128"/> Luſt, and poſſeſſing it with Grace: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the works of the Devil, and creating it the workmanſhip of God: In freeing the Soul from the Ruling Power of ſin in every part, and implanting the Nature and Image of God on every Power and Faculty of it. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14 <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Perſeverance in Grace; Their continuance in a ſtate of grace: And the abiding of the ſeed of God in them: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 'tis the ſame word that ſignifies the Spirits abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Believers, which Chriſt ſaith ſhall be for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 27. This he hath Promiſed in the new Covenant, and therefore this he hath purchaſed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſanctified are called the preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 1. And the Saints are ſaid to be kept by the Power of God through faith unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. This Chriſt ſtands engaged to the Father to do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 12. If Jeſus Chriſt hath not purchaſed perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Grace to the end for all his people, but leaves their continuance in the truth to their free-will, then he leaves them in the ſame ſtate in which they were under the firſt Covenant: For the ſtanding of <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt Covenant was upon his own choice and will; but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, becauſe Chriſt hath taken away the firſt Covenant from Believers, and Eſtabliſhed the ſecond which makes the Commers thereunto perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. to 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Growth in Grace: What he calls them to that he hath purchaſed for them; for Chriſt cannot invite his people to uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48427:128"/> or diſappointments; what he exhorts them to, he promiſeth to work them to, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>Work out your Salvation with fear and trembling; For 'tis God that worketh in you both to will and to do.</hi> Now he bids them to grow in Grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. And this he Promiſeth alſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. 7. <hi>I will be as a dew unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his roots as</hi> Lebanon, <hi>they that dwell under his ſhaddow ſhall revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine.</hi> Pſa. 92. 12. <hi>The Righteous ſhall flouriſh as the Palm-Tree and grow as the Cedars in</hi> Lebanon. What God Promiſed under the new Covenant Chriſt hath dyed for; for this Covenant is wholly Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by blood, by the death of the Teſtator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 17.</p>
               <p>Queſt: <hi>Then what is the reaſon Gods People grow no more in Grace this day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt; All are not <hi>Iſrael</hi> that are of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Many paſſe for Saints in the Judgment of Men which were never ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, nor will appear to be ſo in the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; and therefore ſome in whom you ſee no growth, are no contradiction to this truth at all, they being none of the ſeed of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly; The Lords Trees as well as the Trees of the Wood have their growing times: The Winter is no time to grow; no nor the Winter of Temptation or divine deſertion. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have their growing times, ſo have Souls. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever thy growing time may be yet to come if thou art Chriſts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Souls may grow, though ſlowly, and inviſibly to themſelves and others; Believers
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48427:129"/> have ſometimes a vail on their Eyes, and cannot diſcern their flouriſhing, and ſometimes the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Grace renders it indiſcernable to others. There may be a growing downward in Faith, and Humility, thoſe radical Graces that ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Souls adherence to Chriſt, though there be no growing upwards in fruitfulneſſe for Chriſt. There is a growing in internal longings and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret deſires after more of God, and in higher valuations of Jeſus Chriſt, though not in ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enjoyments of him. As the truth of Grace lies beyond the view of Men, ſo doth many times the growth of grace to a Mans ſelf, and to others.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; The People of God ſhall at laſt have their growth in grace further'd by their preſent decays in Grace. As the ſickneſſe of Children, though it makes them languiſh for a time, yet it helps on their growth when 'tis over; ſo the Winter ſeaſon promotes the growth of Trees and herbs when the Summer comes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; The Lord Jeſus hath Purchaſed for his people Perfection in Grace alſo: This is intended by his death, that they may be made perfect in one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 23. This he preſſeth them to <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 48. <hi>Be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> And what he exhorts them to he prepares and hath redeem'd them to. For this end he gives them Ordinances, that they may come to a perfect Man, to the fulneſſe of the meaſure of the ſtature of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. This perfection of grace is nothing elſe but glory. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:48427:129"/> 
                  <hi>ſhall be done away:</hi> And this Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd for Believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt:</hi> If Chriſt hath Purchaſed perfection in Holineſſe; <hi>Then what's the reaſon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing people of Chriſt are ſo imperfectly Holy, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a day ſince the Goſpel, of more light, and leſſe life; of more profeſſion, and leſs Power of Holineſs; Whence comes this ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt; Theſe are the laſt daies, yea the latter part of the laſt daies, and the Iaſt daies are daies of great unholineſſe, and little grace. O the Catalogue of ſins the Scripture gives us that will abound at that time, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>In the laſt daies Perillous times ſhall come, for Men ſhall be lovers of themſelves—Having a form of Godlineſſe but denying the Power thereof.</hi> Chriſt himſelf ſhews us the complexion of the laſt times: <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 12. <hi>Then Iniquity ſhall abound, and the love of many wax cold.</hi> The daies before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt to avenge his Elect are daies of little Grace: <hi>When the Son of Man comes ſhall he find Faith on the Earth? Luke</hi> 18. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Becauſe of the abundance of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites that get under a profeſſion, and crowd in amongſt Saints: In the laſt times the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number of Men are formaliſts, as you have heard, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. Half at leaſt of Virgin Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors will at the coming of Chriſt be found fooliſh, and abundance of tares among the Wheat, and Goats among the Sheep, will be diſcovered when Chriſt comes to Judgment; and this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the holineſſe of profeſſours, when a great number among them are rotten, and Carnal; unſound Perſons amongſt the ſincere hinder their
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48427:130"/> thriving in Grace, by their Examples and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Company; theſe, as Gangreens, do eat away all holineſs; and as dead bodies become contagious; if the living touch the dead, they are unclean, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 13. Can a man touch Pitch, and not be defiled?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe 'tis the hour, and power of darkneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 53. 'tis a time of great temptation to Gods people: Satan is come down with great wrath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. This <hi>Chap.</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with the Seals and Trumpets, and gives us a repetition of the Churches State un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt and ſecond Perſecution; this <hi>ver.</hi> holds forth the ſecond perſecution under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, when Satan is caſt out of the true Church, and Believers, and comes down among rotten profeſſours, to ſtir them up to perſecution, and then the Devil hath great wrath, eſpecially in the latter part of his Reign, when he hath but a little time; then by temptation as well as perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he labours to deſtroy the Saints holineſs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Gods leaving his people as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of former ſins under preſent Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for their humbling, and driving them nearer to himſelf. Theſe may be ſome Reaſons why there is ſo little holineſs; but however, the time will come when Chriſt will make up his Jewels, and ſet holineſs in the Earth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>This ſanctification of Believers is part, yea, the choiceſt part of Chriſts purchaſed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> I have ſhewn before that Riches import two things. 1. Some things that were of worth and value, men never ſeek great heaps of duſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or ſtraw, as part of their Riches; but Silver,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48427:130"/> Gold, and Jewels, are things of account. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and large meaſures of theſe excellent things. Now ſanctification is a thing of wonderful value, and an unknown excellency in its nature; holineſs muſt needs be excellent becauſe it is a ſparkle of Divine Glory; 'tis part of the Nature and Image of God himſelf, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. 'Tis the Glory of God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 3. When the Prophet would ſet forth God in his Glory, he gives him the name of the holy one, <hi>God came from</hi> Teman, <hi>and the holy one from Mount</hi> Paran, <hi>his Glory covered the Heavens.</hi> The Prophet here ſpeaks and Propheſies of the calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Goſpel, after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, in an alluſion to his former giving the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and making them his people by that Covenant: So <hi>Teman</hi> is a place in <hi>Idumea, Paran</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> between <hi>Sinai</hi> and <hi>Seir,</hi> from whence God gives out his Law, and ſhews out his Glory, as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 3. Some take <hi>Teman</hi> for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then the meaning is thus; As God did formerly manifeſt his Glory, by giving out his Law from Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and his Holineſs in keeping and leading his people through the Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> So will he in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, manifeſt his Glory, in giving the Goſpel, and calling a People to himſelf; and this Glory of his will moſt eminently appear in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Holineſs. So that Holineſs is the Glory of God, and therefore muſt needs be moſt excellent. Nay, Sanctification is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Creature, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 10, 11. The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the latter Church is ſet forth by its Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: So Sanctification and Honour are joyned
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48427:131"/> together, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 4. Holineſs is the greateſt Treaſure; for 'tis laid up in the choiceſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; in Heaven, the place of Gods Holineſs, and the Habitation of the Holy Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 15. Treaſures are not the Poſſeſſion of every one, they are given uſually but to a few: So is Holineſs the priviledge of the feweſt and leaſt number of men; few there be that find it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 13. Riches can procure the greateſt things procurable, as one ſaith; <hi>Money anſwereth all things;</hi> that is all things that are ſaleable among men; ſo Holineſs, though it cannot purchaſe Mercy, yet it fits perſons for the greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and higheſt Services. None more advanced than holy Souls; they dwell in the preſence of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140. 13. They are through Chriſt very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with God; they are fit for the higheſt work. When Perſons come to dye, they ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of holineſs, and would purchaſe it with a world: This proves that Sanctification is a rare Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Again, The purchas'd Holineſs of Chriſt hath not only excellent worth, but large quantity; he hath purchas'd fullneſs of Grace; Grace for Grace. O Believer, though thy heart be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of grace, yet Chriſt's Treaſure is full, he hath as much as ever thou canſt need or crave, to make thee as Holy as thou wouldeſt be, and that to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</label> If Holineſs be the Purchaſe of Chriſt, then 'tis not the Creatures procurement, or by any ways or means obtained ſhort of the merit of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48427:131"/> Chriſt. what the Apoſtle ſays of Righteouſneſs is true of Sanctification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>If Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> So if holineſs be the Fruit of Mens Purpoſes, Labours and Duties, then Chriſt died in vain. 'Tis too common an errour in many, to charge Chriſt with too much in ſome things, and too little in other things. In juſtification ſome lay too much on Chriſt; I mean by charging their ſins on him for pardon, which they were never throughly convinc'd or repented of; and in ſanctification charge him with too little, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their holineſs and meetneſs from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, duties, and improvements: As if holineſs were to grow out of the Sepulchres of their Services, and not out of the grave of Chriſt: 'Tis true indeed the Lord Jeſus hath appointed means for the promoting of Holineſs, and given promiſes and Ordinances for the conveying and perfecting of it, but the vertue of all depends upon his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Then how unexcuſable are periſhing Sinners under the Goſpel, that will not come to Chriſt to be made holy. You that lye in your blood, and from the Crown of your head to the ſole of your feet are full of filthy Ulcers, and putrifying ſores; whoſe Conſciences cannot but condemn you ſometimes for uncleanneſſe; and never being cleanſed by the blood of Chriſt; how will you appear before the Holy God, a Conſuming fire, in your unpurged ſins? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable is your filthyneſſe who might have been cleanſed, but would not! What will you anſwer in the day of Indignation, when all this tender'd,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48427:132"/> but refuſed Grace ſhall come againſt you? when you would willingly part with the whole World if you had it to get a clean heart and a purged Conſcience? How dreadful will that word be in the day of Inquiſition; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 24. <hi>Thou art a Land, Thou art a Soul that art not cleanſed?</hi> How cutting will the memory be of rejected Grace, when God ſhall ſay, <hi>I would have healed you, but you are not healed? Jer.</hi> 51. 9. You might have had your natures changed, your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cleanſed, and your hearts ſanctified, but you would not: Now away thou prophane hard-hearted wretch: Be gone thou ſecret Drunkard, Swearer, Thief, Lyer, take him Devil, go and be filthy ſtill, wallow in thy blood; there lye curſing in torment to all Eternity; as long as I am God, thy blood ſhall lye upon thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Then the Holineſſe of Believers is and ſhall be ſure, being grounded on the Purchaſe of Chriſt. 'Tis bought, and paid for (O Believer) for thee: purchas'd Sanctification is aſſuredly thine as thou art not thine own; The truth, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, growth, and perfection of Grace is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for thee by a price: A price agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God will not deny it, Juſtice it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with-hold thy purchas'd due. As ſure as Chriſt with-holds not one drop of his blood, or penny of the price, ſo ſure will not God with-hold any part of this Purchaſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>That he may be juſt, and the juſtifier of them that believe in Jeſus:</hi> And if the juſtifier, then ſure the ſanctifier. Poor doubting Believer, when thou ſeeſt nothing but unworthineſs in thy ſelf of the leaſt Grace, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48427:132"/> peace from God, then think, 'twas Chriſt, not I, that made this purchaſe; he who did not, can not make a forfeit of his right; and whoſe blood muſt periſh, whoſe Honour and Intereſt muſt ſuffer, if one of thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed ſhould dye and periſh for want of Holineſſe: O no! this cannot be; <hi>The Judge of all the Earth muſt do right.</hi> Gen. 18. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt the believers Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate cannot ſuffer to ſee his poor and needy depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their right: He is the Mediatour betwixt God and his people; The days-Man and Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to ſee truth Eſtabliſhed in the Earth, and every one to receive his due: He will give wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Men their due, much more his Children; And all Power in Heaven and Earth are in his hands, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20. He is the Faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Holy, and Juſt one, and therefore will cauſe that believers ſhall have the diſtributions of the due Meaſures of his Purchas'd Grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is nothing in thee or without thee that can hinder the accompliſhment of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 13. <hi>I will work, and who ſhall let:</hi> Let Earth and Hell, Sin and ſelf, combine together, they ſhall not keep back the Communications of grace one day beyond God's time, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 20. 'Tis not the ſtrength of thy luſts can prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the arm of God, and forces of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, who is commiſſioned to bring down all thy Enemies, and ſet thee free indeed. Chriſt will Reign till he brings down all his Enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25. The greateſt part of which is the Corruptions of his people.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Adoption-Grace prov'd to be the Fruit of Chriſt's Purchaſe: The excellency of this ſtate opened in ſeveral particulars.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Come now to a fifth Fruit of Chriſts Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and diſcovery of that glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption-Treaſure procur'd by his death; <hi>that is</hi> a ſtate of Adoption, thoſe whom he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies he adopts, and brings into a new Relation to himſelf; to God the Father, Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: The work of Sanctification doth change their Nature, Adoption changeth their ſtate; they are really alter'd by Sanctifying Grace, and relatively by Adoption-love. God now becomes their Father, and they are his Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>Come out from amongſt them, and touch not the unclean thing:</hi> Here's a change in their Nature and Life: <hi>And I will be your God, and you ſhall be my Sons and Daughters:</hi> there's a change in their ſtate: Adoption is the taking of perſons that are ſtrangers, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in themſelves, into a ſtate and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sons and Heirs; bringing them into a new Family and Condition: And ſuch is the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sons of God, 'tis a Tranſlation of called and ſanctified Souls out of the Family of Satan into the Family of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:48427:133"/> 
                  <hi>power to become the Sons of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. <hi>Now are we the Sons of God:</hi> And this Adoption-Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is the Fruit of the Death of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>When the fullneſs of time was come God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law; to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons:</hi> For though this Adoption be an act of Grace in God, to take Souls into Sonſhip with him; yet 'tis by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children, by Jeſus Chriſt: That is,</hi> To be redeemed, and made fit for it by Jeſus Chriſt. Now in the Adoption of Sanctified Souls into the Family of God there are theſe five things.</p>
               <p>A change, 1. of Relation. 2. Of Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3. Of Diſpoſition. 4. Of Condition. 5. Of Duty.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There's a change of Relation; they were the Children of the Devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. Heirs of Hell, and under the Power of the God of this World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Who rules in the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> They were of the kindred of Hell, of that Family whoſe Head and Ruler is Satan. This was their ſtate, when Redemption-grace found them. Now Adoption alters this relation, and being taken out of this Family by effectual calling, they are by Adoption entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new Relation, and made the Sons and Daughters of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. Now they can call God their Father, Chriſt their Husband; the Saints their Brethren, <hi>verſe.</hi> 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Ye are no more Strangers, and Forreigners, but Fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:48427:134"/>
               <p> Secondly, A change of Obligation; they were bound to the Law of Satan, under the Law of Sin, and Slavery of the World, led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by Satan at his Will, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. But when Adoption-grace comes, it delivers them from this Obligation, and they are brought under the power of God, and Scepter of his Kingdom, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14, 17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a change of Diſpoſition; they have the Nature and Spirit of Children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. They were by Nature Enemies, but now are Children; they have a diſpoſition to love God, to honour and obey him, 'tis their Meat and Drink to do his will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 34. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. To ſerve Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was burdenſome, but now delightful: The Love of Chriſt conſtrains them: 'Tis as natural for them now to obey Chriſt, as ever it was to rebel againſt him; they are never ſatisfi'd but when God is well pleas'd.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A change in their State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they are brought into a ſtate of Glorious Priviledges, in reſpect of, 1. <hi>Liberty,</hi> 2. Rights and Intereſts. 3. Boldneſs. 4. Inſtruction. 5. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. 6. Proviſion. 7. Protection. 8. Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: And by theſe the ſtate of an Adopted Soul appears to be a glorious ſtate.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are brought into a ſtate of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 36. If the Son ſhall make you free then are you free indeed (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) The word Imports that Freedom that is oppoſed to Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as it appears alſo by the word, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. Chriſt tells them, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>The truth ſhall make</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:48427:134"/> 
                  <hi>them free;</hi> And they anſwered him; <hi>We be</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams <hi>ſeed, and were never in bondage to any Man:</hi> So that by freedom here, Chriſt intends a delivering of them from that bondage they were in by reaſon of ſin and Satan: and he tells them that this is that freedom that comes by him; all that are the Children of God are free Men and Women. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty:</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells them, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. That the Miniſtration of the Spirit is much more glorious than that of the Law, or letter; that is, the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is far more Excellent than that of the Law, which he proves by ſeveral arguments: And here he tells us that the Lord is that Spirit, that is, the Lord Jeſus is the Author of that Spirit, or Spritual Miniſtration, under the Goſpel, and where that Spirit or Adminiſtration is, or where the Soul is brought into this Goſpel-ſtate, there is liberty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21. Now this liberty that all the Children of God are brought into is a two-fold liberty. 1. A liberty from Servitude. 2. A liberty to ſervice. Or as a Reverend writer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it: <hi>A liberty from the Family of Satan, and liberty in the Family of God.</hi> There are ſome things which all Adopted Souls have a liberty from, and ſome things they have a liberty in or to.</p>
               <p>Firſt, All that are Adopted in Chriſt are ſet free from that ſlavery they were in under the Law Sin, Satan, and the World. They are freed from Bondage under the Law, from Bondage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and Bondage-wrath: All that are under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as all are who are out of Chriſt,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48427:135"/> are oblig'd to Bondage-work, to the work of ſlaves, not of free Men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they are bound to do work that is above their ſtrength, which they can never perform, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. The Law was weak through the fleſh, that is, there was an impotency in fallen Man ever to fulfil the Law, or attain life by it: The Law required perfect, and perpetual Obedience; but this could never be performed by ſinful Man, and therefore legal-work, was hard work, work ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be done by fallen Man, and this is bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage-work.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Legal-work is mercenary work; Do this and live. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>The Man that doth them ſhall live in them:</hi> Like a Servant, if he doth his work he ſhall have his wages, if not he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing; and this is hard indeed, that the poor weak Creature that is utterly deſtitute of all ſtrength, worth, and ability, muſt have no more than can deſerve.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; 'Tis rigorous work, preſt by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſeverity, threatnings of death and Hell to all the Tranſgreſſours of it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly; 'Tis fruitleſs work, works that cannot make the comers thereunto perfect. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. 'Tis Labour in vain. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; 'Tis work without Wages, no reward at all could ever be received from it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21, 22. <hi>For had there been a Law which could have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Life, verily Righteouſneſs had been by the Law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin.</hi> &amp;c. There is no Life, no Crown, no Kingdom at all
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48427:135"/> is the reward of all ſuch labours.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, 'Tis work that will ſurely end in death: Let men work never ſo hard yet they muſt dye, and be damn'd at laſt for falling ſhort, and this is bondage-work indeed; but the Children of God are freed from this work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>But now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein we are held, that we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of Spirit, and not in oldneſs of the letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, As they are freed from bondage-work, ſo are they freed from bondage-wrath: The wrath of God is upon all the Children of diſobedience; all Chriſtleſs Souls are Children of wrath, bound over to an Inheritance of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3. Becauſe the Law worketh wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. It brings all its Servants under wrath, under the curſe, and under death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. But from this alſo are all the Sons of God freed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>And deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the Devil.</hi> And not only from the Devil, but from the works of the Devil. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p>Again they are free from all yokes of bondage laid on their Conſciences by Men. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the Servants of Men:</hi> Do not give up your Faith and Conſcience to their Commands, obey not them contrary to the Command of Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10, 11. if I yet pleaſed men I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt. This is the firſt part of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty the Children of God are brought into, even a liberty from Servitude.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have a liberty to ſervice in the Worſhip of God: Their ſervice of God
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48427:136"/> is free and ingenuous Service; their offerings are free-will Offerings. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. 108. <hi>Accept the free-will offerings of my mouth.</hi> That is, thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings or vows which my mouth hath freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. The Children of God are a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110. 3. They ſerve the Lord freely from the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. They obey from the heart that form of Doctrine deliver'd to them; They delight in the Law of God after the inner Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. The ſtricteſt Service of God is to them the moſt deſired liberty, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God are no wayes grievous to them; that is, to their inner Man, indeed ſo far as fleſh and Corruption get head, they drag heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to duty, when the ſpring of their motions, even their child-like love to God is abated, and all the Indiſpoſitions of a child of God flow from decaies of love to God, and ſome abatement of the Adoption-Spirit in him: The Children of God are never in their Element, or as they would be, but when their hearts ſlow out after God, and they can run the paths of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this they pray and labour for, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. 32. <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandements when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart.</hi> So ver. 69. <hi>I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.</hi> Their hearts move naturally after God when in their right temper: As the Waters run towards the Sea, and the Sun runs his race: Their ſervice of God comes from a new Principle, even from Faith that works by love, and is directed to new and higher ends, than all the ſervices of Hypocrites: The ſenſe of divine love conſtrains them to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they cannot but chuſe the things that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48427:136"/> pleaſe God, further than they are bound back by Corruption, and Temptation; their works are wrought in God from a Principle of life, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and revived by grace; They have no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary aimes in their Duties to attain any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſelfiſh end below God, but their Motives are high and heavenly, pure and ſpiritual, as the Love of God, and care they have to pleaſe him: They ſee a beauty in Holineſs, and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs in the ways of God, and find a ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their hearts, to love theſe though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der never ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> great diſcouragements, and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to fleſh and blood; hence 'tis a Child of God cannot caſt off God and his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though he ſee nothing of good or comfort coming in by them, nor be perſwaded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any thing that is ſinful, though to ſave his purſe, perſon, yea life it ſelf: All the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Men, or viſible dangers in his way, can't bring his heart to comply with ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſpeak or do any thing againſt God, his people, or wayes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>We can do nothing againſt the truth.</hi> None but a <hi>Judas</hi> can come with a Band of men and Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt to apprehend him, or his people for owning him: <hi>Micaiah</hi> would ſpeak nothing againſt the truth, though to pleaſe a King. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 17. Nor <hi>Jacobs</hi> Soul enter into the ſecret of the wicked in their ſinful enterpriſe: A fearful <hi>Peter</hi> may forſake the profeſſing of Chriſt for a time, but he will not be ſeen on the ſide of thoſe that do oppoſe him; no, this is far from the true Spirit of Gods Children: We read of the Chriſtians in the primitive times,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48427:137"/> that left their preferments, rather than they would be ſeen againſt Chriſt people; and the whole Legion choſe rather to lay down their lives, than to oppoſe their fellow Chriſtians: Such ſhufflings and Compliances are oppoſed to the Spirit of the true Children of God; they can run after God in a Wilderneſs, but cannot be drawn againſt God by all the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have new Rights and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts: Believers being once entred into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of God by Chriſt, are preſently inveſted with new and Glorious Rights whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they never had before, nor any beſides the Chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ren of God have or can ever have; which will appear in theſe fix things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They have a right to the ſpecial and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed preſence of God the Father, Son, and Spirit. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 140. 13. <hi>The upright ſhall dwell in thy preſence.</hi> The upright, that is, the faithful, the Children of God, theſe ſhall dwell in thy preſence, in thy ſpecial preſence, for all Men and Devils are in the general preſence of God, but the Saints ſhall be in Gods ſpecial preſence; and not ſtep into it only as ſtrangers may, but continue for ever as Sons. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 35. <hi>The ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever, but the Son abideth ever, Pſa.</hi> 26. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly. They have a right to the purchaſe of Chriſt, to all the fruit of his Obedience, and ſufferings: His blood is theirs, with all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curements of it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed:</hi> whatever Chriſt dyed for
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48427:137"/> according to the agreement betwixt the Father and him, is the Right of his Children, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They have right to the Promiſes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promiſes.</hi> Whereby, that is, by the knowledge of him, as <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Or through Faith in him, that is, by Jeſus Chriſt we come to have right to the promiſes, for all the promiſes are in him Yea and Amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. The promiſes of this Life and of that which is to come, all are theirs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They have Right to Communion with, and to the bleſſing of the whole Family of Chriſt: Being entred into Gods Family, they have a Right to fellowſhip with all his people, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>For by one Spirit are we baptiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, Bond or Free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> The great deſign of the Apoſtle in this <hi>chap.</hi> is to ſhew that all Believers are brought into neareſt Union with Chriſt, and each other, even into one body; this he proves in this <hi>ver.</hi> by the end of the Ordinances of Baptiſm, and the Supper, both which do ſignifie and ſeal up Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the neareſt Union and Communion, by reaſon of which they have equal right to one another, and the whole body, they have right to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Angels and Saints: All the Sons and Daughters of God, have right to his Houſe; to his Church, and all the priviledges of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 5. Ordinances and Miniſters are theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. Yea, they have right to the bleſſings of God on all: <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Thy</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:48427:138"/> 
                  <hi>bleſſing is upon thy People, Eph.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They have a right to all the good things of this Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>He that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhall inherit all things:</hi> Even the good things of this Life, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. 9. <hi>They that wait on the Lord ſhall inherit the Earth.</hi> They are Heirs with Chriſt, who is Heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. They have through Chriſt a Right to all the good things of this world, ſo far as God ſees it beſt for them; they have their right in the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is Lord of all; this is a New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Right; not over other mens rights to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade or break the civil properties of any, but to thoſe Creatures God gives them, and to the good of all things, even wants and enjoyments, and have a ſanctified uſe of them, which none but the Children of God have, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, They have Right to the inheritance of Glory, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. Heaven is the Country, Home, and Inheritance of all Saints: Their Title is founded on the Purchaſe of Chriſt, and Adoption of Grace: not upon their Merit or Holineſs; and therefore 'tis called on the account of Chriſt, the purchaſed poſſeſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Which is the earneſt of our inheritance, until the Redemption of the purchaſed Poſſeſſion.</hi> That is until we are actually redeemed from Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and put into the poſſeſſion of purchaſed Glory; yea their Reverſion in Heaven is ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procured for them, without any of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or price, duties or obedience, further than 'tis the way to walk in to Glory; that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life is ſaid to be the gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48427:138"/> Death comes by Man's merit, but not Life and Salvation: and is not this a glorious ſtate, and bleſſed condition, to be made Heirs, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>And if Children, then heirs, and Joynt-heirs with Chriſt:</hi> partakers of the ſame Rights with him, Heirs of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. So was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and ſo are are all Believers; they have a right to Juſtification, by believing; and a right to the Kingdom of Glory, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Heirs of the Kingdom:</hi> They have as good a Title to this by Grace, and through the purchaſe of Chriſt, as any man to an Inheritance here on Earth, yea, and far more ſure of it; for men may be turn'd out of their Rights and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here; but Believers cannot be deprived of their Title, and Inheritance through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, They have an intereſt in Gods love, they are upon his Heart at all times, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 27. <hi>For the Father himſelf loveth you:</hi> He loves with an infinite Love, a Love paſſing knowledge, and tranſcending the love of all Creatures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 15. A Mother may forget her Child, but God cannot forget his: He loves at all times; Eternally, and unchangeably: He loves his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ardently, when they have but little love to him: He loves them notwithſtanding their unkindneſſes and provocations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 31, 32, 33. He loves them when he ſeems to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, and is forced to correct them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. He always thinketh on them for good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 11. <hi>I know the thoughts I think to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, ſaith the Lord, thoughts of Peace, and not of Evil.</hi> He is very tender of them, and hath

               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, They have a right to the Spirit of Grace, the Spirit is put into their Hearts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. Not the ſpirit of Bondage, but of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16. They have union with the Spirit never to be ſeperated more, <hi>v.</hi> 11. they have the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. To quicken, teach, influence, aſſiſt in Duty, and make interceſſion for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. O what a bleſſed priviledge is this to have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Son, whereby they can go to God as a Father, and to have the Spirit working in them the diſpoſition, and working for them the actions of Sons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They have holy and reverential boldneſs to come into the preſence of God through his Son, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 26. 6. <hi>I will waſh my ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And plead their cauſe through Chriſt with boldneſs, <hi>Heb</hi> 10. 19, 20. And they are not only free to come, but ſure to ſpeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23, 24. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Inſtruction is another Priviledge of Sons, <hi>They ſhall be taught of God, Iſa.</hi> 54. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48427:139"/> of God, and revealeth them to the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 20. He wll teach them all things which they are able to bear: They ſhall have the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſts mind, to ſteer their courſe whiles in this Wilderneſs of the World, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the revelation of all truths neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They have choice and delicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and rich maintenance; this is the duty of Parents to provide for their Obedient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Children, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>But if any man provide not for his own Houſe he hath denyed the Faith:</hi> He cares for his Children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 31, 32. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. He that gives his Son, how can he but with him freely give us all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your wants:</hi> He that gives a Kingdom at the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, will not deny Bread and Water in the way: He will provide for their Bodies and Souls, for their Perſons and Families.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Correction is theirs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 8. Correction is the Saints Priviledge, and great advantage; they have need of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Though for a ſeaſon, if need be, you are in heavineſs,</hi> &amp;c. And they have advantage by it, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted,</hi> Heb. 12. 10. <hi>But he for our profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, Protection is another priviledge of Children: He will keep them as the Apple of his Eye, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 17. 8. He will hide them in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his Tabernacle, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31. 20. He will keep them Day and Night, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. He gives his Angels charge concerning them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 91. 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:48427:140"/>
               <p> Laſtly, The Kingdom is theirs: O think what reſt, what joy, what holineſs, what perfection, what immutability, and Eternity of Glory is in Heaven! and ſay, all this is my Eſtate by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I ſhall one day be poſſeſſed of it; here I am poor, but there I ſhall be rich, here I am em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty and hungry, there I ſhall be full: here I am deſpiſed, there I ſhall be honoured; here I have not a houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lay my head in, there I ſhall have a Manſion to all Eternity; here one and another ſays, come ſit at my Foot, there ſhall I ſit on a Throne, and be a Crowned King for ever: Here my Comforts go, and my troubles ſtay; worms breed in all my enjoyments, but thereis no Ruſt, nor Moth; no Decay, nor Death. O bleſſed ſtate indeed that Believers are Adopted to in Chriſt!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The laſt conſiderable thing in Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, the Duties that flow from ſuch a ſtate, and this is part of their priviledge alſo, as being the Fruit of an Adoption-ſtate, and that which they are purchas'd as well as oblig'd unto by the blood of Chriſt; all the filial duties of Believers are the fruits of Adoption-Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts.</hi> The Spirit of his Son to make you really ſuch, and to form in you the Nature, and work you to the duty of Sons. So that Adopted Souls are not only choſen of God to be heirs with Chriſt, but are alſo begotten of God into the Nature and Image of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 29. <hi>Whom he did foreknow, them he did predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to be conformed to the Image of his Son;</hi> that as Chriſt carryed himſelf as a Son, ſo ſhould the Children of God in their meaſure, and time
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48427:140"/> and that by the ſame Spirit. Now theſe duties which Gods Children are ſpirited and engaged to, are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To love God as their Father, even from a ſenſe of his Fatherly love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> Deut. 6. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy might:</hi> The Lord thy God, becauſe he hath pleaſed to make thee his Son, and to place thee in ſo near and high rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 31. 23. <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints:</hi> You that are ſet apart for him, and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; O you of all Perſons from the ſenſe of this relation ſhould love him. This is a filial duty, and ſo eſſential to Sons, as that 'tis put for the ground of all their Obedience. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him;</hi> that is, <hi>manifeſt</hi> his love to him as a Father. This is not a forced but a natural love to God ariſing from that new Nature and Spirit of Adoption in them; ſo that a Child of God may as well ceaſe to be a Child, as ceaſe to have a diſpoſition to love him: Indeed a gracious Soul may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes actually love God, but he hath a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to love him, and can appeal to God that he knows he would love him, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all the World he can value like him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To obey him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>As o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Children, not faſhioning your ſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to former Luſts.</hi> 'Tis a great duty of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to obey their Parents in all things lawful, and ſo they that are Gods Children are much more oblig'd to obey God, whoſe relation much more binds them, being ſo far above all other
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48427:141"/> relations, whoſe love conſtrains them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. whoſe Laws invite them, they being holy, juſt, and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. Whoſe rewards alſo encourageth them, there is a reward in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 19. 11. and a reward upon thoſe that keep them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. Now this Child-like obedience differs from all other obedience; in that, 1. 'Tis the fruit of faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 47. <hi>He that is of God heareth Gods word,</hi> that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth Gods word; but what an Obedience is this, ſee the former <hi>ver.</hi> It is an Obedience from faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 46. <hi>If I ſay the truth why do ye not believe me?</hi> 2. 'Tis the labour of love, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Remembring without ceaſing your work of Faith and labour of love.</hi> 3. 'Tis delightful Obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inner Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A fear of offending him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>And ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs in the latter daies.</hi> This is a filial fear ariſing from their relation to God as their Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>And if you call on the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear.</hi> This is a fear ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from and conſiſting with love; there is a fear that love caſteth out, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>perfect love caſteth out fear,</hi> that is ſlaviſh fear: 'Tis ſuch a fear as keeps the Soul cloſe to God, and not drive him from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 40. O how fearful is ſuch a Soul of offending God, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 31. He will do all he can to prevent ſin, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. 11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart that I may not ſin againſt thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, A zeal for Gods glory, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69. 9. <hi>The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me up:</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:48427:141"/> That is, the zeal which I have for thy houſe or for thy pure Worſhip, againſt them that would corrupt it, hath like fire conſumed me. Zeal is the burning fire of love which will not bear any thing that diſhonours God: So <hi>Phinehas</hi> could not endure to ſee God diſhonoured by the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of his People, but in his zeal executes the Law upon one of the higheſt offenders, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 11. The want of the zeal made <hi>Laodicea</hi> in danger of being ſpued out of Gods mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. and therefore God calls her to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to this zealous Spirit in his Worſhip, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Be zealous and Repent.</hi> This zeal was that Child-like temper that God commended in <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> 2. 2. Thou canſt not bear them that are evil: A zealous Soul cannot ſuffer any reproach on Gods Name, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69. 20. <hi>Reproach hath broken my heart.</hi> This Child-like zeal in <hi>Craeſus</hi> dumb Son open'd his mouth when his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in danger to be ſlain.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A fiducial dependence on his care and faithfulneſs, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want:</hi> Rom. 8. 32. 1 Pet. 5. 7. <hi>Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your care upon him, for he careth for you:</hi> This was the Child-like confidence of <hi>Job</hi> in his God, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 15. Though he ſlay me yet will I truſt in him: This dependence on the Fathers care quieted <hi>Muſculus,</hi> when he was forc'd to labour in the Town Ditch for his Maintenance.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Eſt deus in Coelis qui providus omnia curat,</l>
                  <l>Credentes nunquam deſeruiſſe poteſt.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Mat. 6. 32. <hi>Your Heavenly Father knows you have need of all theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Humble Submiſſion to him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48427:142"/> 9. <hi>Shall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits and live,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The word notes an orderly ſubjection, according to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and place in which God hath ſet a Man, that ſubjection that is in an Inferiour to a Superiour: The ſame word is uſed of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 51. <hi>And he went down with them to</hi> Nazareth, <hi>and was ſubject to them,</hi> that is, ſubmitted himſelf to that place duty he owed to them as his Parents.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, A carefulneſs to pleaſe him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4. <hi>That chuſe the things that pleaſe me, to them will I give within my houſe, a place and a Name better than of Sons and Daughters.</hi> That is, ſuch will I own for my Family, my Sons and Daughters, that chuſe the things that pleaſe me. So did the Lord Jeſus evidence his filial duty to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>I do alway the things that pleaſe him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 22.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, An endeavour in all things imitable to reſemble him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>As he that called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation.</hi> Luke 6. 36. <hi>Be ye merciful as your Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is merciful.</hi> Mat. 5. 48. <hi>Be ye perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect; that is,</hi> In the grace of love to Enemies. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Be ye followers of of God as dear Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, A labouring to walk worthy of ſo high relation, and nearneſs unto God. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>That you walk would worthy of God who hath called you to his Kingdom and Glory:</hi> Worthy of ſo high a Calling, like the Children of a King; like <hi>Gideons</hi> Brethren, who all reſembled the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of a King; <hi>Judges</hi> 8. 18. Your duty is to live above the Children of this World, who

               <p>Laſtly, A maintaining a real Love to your Brethren, and an endeavour to live peaceably with them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Love as Brethren, be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, be courteous,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Joh. 5. 1. <hi>Every one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that loves him that begetteth, loveth him alſo that is begotten,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 11.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</label> Thus you ſee what a glorious Treaſure A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption-grace is; view over this Inventory (Believer) and tell me what thou thinkeſt of it: Is it not a Treaſure indeed, which all the Gold of <hi>Ophi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> cannot equallize? Nor all the glory of the World worthy to be compared with? And ſee all this procured by the Sweat and Blood, the Obedience and Death of the Son of God; and then ſay, whether Chriſt be not precious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: Look upon the Children of this World in all their Glory; view their priviledges in their utmoſt latitude and extent; and anſwer me whether a Believer in rags doth not far ſurpaſs them. Chriſt ſpeaks of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he in all his Glory, was not to be compared to one Lilly
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48427:143"/> in the Field. So one Saint, and Child of God infinitely excels the Great men of this World, in all their Grandure, and Advancements. O then admire the Lord Jeſus on this account alſo, for procuring Adoption-grace.</p>
               <p>1. Queſt. <hi>But how may I know whether I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Adoption-grace?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a point worth the enquiring into, and ſatisfaction in ſo fundamental a point is very neceſſary: But 'tis the Office of Gods Spirit to ſeal us up to the day of Redemption, and bear witneſs with our Spirits that we are the Children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. Men may lay down marks, but 'tis God muſt determine the Queſt. yet notwithſtanding for thy reſolution, (Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such are partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are really Sons, as well as Relatively, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. They have the Image of God inſtampt upon their Souls: They have the ſeed of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Faith, Love, Hope, Patience, and Humility in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. And they have received of his fulneſs, Grace for Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such prize nothing in all the world like to Relation to God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. 25. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is exceeding precious to ſuch in whom they are choſen, and by whom this Grace comes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>To you that believe he is precious.</hi> None in Heaven or Earth that they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue like to Chriſt, they account all things but droſs and dung, in compariſon of Chriſts excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>

               <p> Fourthly, Such will employ their greateſt care to imitate God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſuch have a Spirit of prayer and ſupplication, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying</hi> Abba <hi>Father:</hi> Not Parts, not Light, not the gifts of Prayer only, but ſuch a Soul hath the Spirit of Prayer, very ſtrong ſtrains of Faith and Love run through all his Duties: He hath a Spirit of boldneſs whereby he comes to God as to a Father.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Confirmation of the new Covenant is the Fruit of Chriſt's purchaſe, prov'd by ſeveral Arguments.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANother glorious Fruit of Chriſts blood, and purchaſed Treaſure for ſaved Souls, is, the eſtabliſhment of the new Covenant, to Believers, and Believers in the Covenant. This is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain effect of Chriſt's death, the making ſure the Covenant to all his ſeed: That there is no more poſſibility of making it void to the Heirs of promiſe. This is the great thing undertaken in the new Covenant, that it ſhall be ſure to all the ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>There are Eight things which ſecure this to Believers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This new Covenant muſt needs be firm and unalterable, becauſe the reaſon why God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>und fault with the old Covenant; was, becauſe
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48427:144"/> it was weak, and could not ſecure thoſe that were within it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9. <hi>Which Covenant they brake; though I was an Husband to them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31. 32. Now if this were the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why God did alter the firſt Covenant; then the new Covenant he makes in the room of it, muſt n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eds be free from this Imperfection and mutability, or elſe it would abundantly reflect on the infinite wiſdom of God to make a new Covenant guilty of the ſame errour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This was Gods deſign in making a new Covenant, that it might be ordered in all things, and ſure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. That it might be firm, and eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. Why are they called better promiſes? Are there better promiſes than the promiſes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Glory? They are called better, becauſe more pure and abſolute promiſes, and becauſe it was Gods deſign to make them ſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is confirmed by the blood of Chriſt, and therefore the blood of Chriſt is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the blood of the Covenant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament:</hi> 'Tis the blood of the new Teſtament, in that it ſeals to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Covenant. The death of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour makes the Teſtament to be in full force, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 17. That now all the Promiſes and Legacies are certain, and cannot be diſappointed to the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees and Heirs of Salvation. Again, this blood of Chriſt is the blood of the Covenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it, in that it makes good all the conditions of it, that whatever is required to make this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant good, is undertaken by Chriſt, in the behalf of all his feed, and therefore he is called
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48427:145"/> the ſurety of the new Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. By death he hath fulfill'd the Condition of the firſt, and undertaken for the fulfilling of this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in and by Believers: Yea, his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is for them, to preſent them compleat to the Father, notwithſtanding all their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This new Covenant is ſure to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, becauſe the Adminiſtation of it is in the hands of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>But now he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a more excellent Miniſtery, by how much he is the Mediatour of a better Covenant.</hi> The whole truſt about the Adminiſtration of new-Covenant-bleſſings, is devolved on Jeſus Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called the Mediator, and Miniſter of the Covenant: So that the Covenant muſt needs be ſure, ſeeing the diſpoſe thereof is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact betwixt the Father and Chriſt, deliver'd into his hand upon the account of his death: Now he that is the Believers Friend, Head, and Husband, hath all power in Heaven and Earth, to make good the Covanent to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. So that the promiſes of the Covenant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forfeited by Believers, being made over to Chriſt as to a Truſtee for them, and their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſtate alſo being ſo ſurely confirm'd, that they cannot fall from it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt's ſufficiency to ſee new-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-promiſes made good, and new-Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends accompliſhed to them, is ſecurity enough for their ſafety. He is an alſufficient Saviour, able to ſave to the utmoſt, all that come to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. He is able to ſee Gods part fulfilled, having all the promiſes in his hand, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48427:145"/> all the things promiſed at his diſpoſe; and he is able to ſee the Believers part fulfilled alſo, for he hath all that in him which is needful for the making of the Condition good on their part: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, He hath all Wiſdom in him, to make them wiſe to Salvation, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>He is made of God to his people Wiſdom,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God to receive Wiſdom for them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they need to guide them in the way, and fit them for Salvation: Knowledge is neceſſary to Eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. The Image of God conſiſts partly in it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. Without it the heart is not good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 2. No Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. No Obedience without Knowledge, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18. 44. This is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to diſcern the wiles of Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. The ſinfulneſs of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13. The preciouſneſs of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. The beauty of holineſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110. 3. The love of Chriſt, that paſſeth knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19. The <hi>hope</hi> of your calling, and the things freely given of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. And for this end all Wiſdom is laid up in Chriſt to be given out to his people by his Spirit through his word; hence 'tis ſaid, that Believers have an Unction from the holy one, to teach them all things, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20, 27. And the promiſe of the Spirit is made to them, to lead them into all truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. So that whatever is needful for Saints to fit them for Covenant-Duties and Mercies, all this is in Chriſt for them, and ſo he is able to make the Covenant good to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He hath all Grace in him that tends to the fulfilling of this Covenant in Believers and for them: He hath received the Spirit without
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48427:146"/> meaſure; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. And why is this? But that from his fullneſs Believers may receive Grace for Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. He is the fullneſs that fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23. And therefore hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Grace ſufficient to his people in all their temptations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. under all their burdens, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 55. 22. For all duties and undertakings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He hath all power in Heaven, and Earth put into his hand, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 18. Power to bruiſe Satan under his peoples feet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20. To ſubdue Corruptions in them, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 19. To vanquiſh all their Enemies for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11. To heal all their backſlidings, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4. To work all their works in them, and for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12. To give them Faith, and to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. To keep them faithful to the death, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3. And to ſecure the promiſed Fruit of all for them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12. and therefore ſufficiently able to make good Covenant-Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to them, and to fulfill Covenant-duties in them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Chriſts engagement to, and for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his intereſt in them, is another ground for the fulfilling of the Covenant; <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath promiſed the Father that he will bring them all to Glory, and hath undertaken all their work for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. And he hath promiſed to them to make good his Covenant when he perſwaded their hearts to him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9, <hi>to</hi> 13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 11. Again his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in them is ſecurity enough: All the fruit of his death and purchaſe lies in the fulfilling of the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48427:146"/> Covenant; if that be broken, he loſeth all his hopes, and Obedience, he hath dyed in vain, his blood and Interceſſion are to no purpoſe, for herein lies all the travel of his Soul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10, 11. In this is the enjoyment of all his delights, if this Covenant be not ſure then no Soul can be ſaved, and Chriſt ſhould loſe thoſe delights he had in the habitable parts of the Earth before the World was made. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 31. Saved Souls are Chriſts Crown and Glory, and how mangled and defective would Chriſts Crown be, ſhould any one Periſh who are intereſted in this Covenant? Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this depends all Chriſts Mediatory Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4, 5. And ſhould there be a failure here, he would loſe his expected Glory as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour. So that you ſee the fruit of his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, the delight of his Soul, and his Eternal Glory with the Father, are all wrapt up in the accompliſhment of this Covenant.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Immutability of Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and the certainty of his engagement, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an Oath, renders the new Covenant ſure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew to the heirs of promiſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his Counſel confirm'd it by an Oath:</hi> Theſe are two immutable things, Gods purpoſe, and his engagement, and becauſe theſe could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no variation, therefore the things Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed muſt be fulfill'd indue time. Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but the Counſel of God that muſt ſtand: 'Tis laid upon Infinite Wiſdom, and all things in order to the fullfiling of it, are made ſo ſure, that it cannot poſſibly be fruſtrated: He wants not ſufficient Power and faithfulneſs to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48427:147"/> reach his own deſigns, and therefore what he hath determined muſt come to paſs, and upon this purpoſe of God is laid his promiſe: He having firſt reſolved upon it, is engaged to it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Another reaſon to prove the certainty of the new Covenant is taken from the nature of the promiſes; they are abſolute; 'tis true there are ſome conditional promiſes as the effects of the other, but the fundamental promiſes, and thoſe which compleat the Covenant of grace are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abſolute; 'tis true alſo, faith is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary qualification to intereſt a Perſon in theſe promiſes, but when the Soul comes to have a propriety in them, the tenure of them then is abſolute, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. He will put his Spirit within them, and will cauſe them to walk in his Statutes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, to 28. <hi>I will be a God to them, and they ſhall be my People,</hi> Jer. 32. 40. <hi>And I will make an Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good: But I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> In which you ſee the condition is undertaken and ſecured, as well as the promiſe and things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; had it indeed depended upon conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal promiſes alone, which doubting Souls have moſt in their eye, then the failure of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have forfeited the promiſes, and then they had been null'd: But you ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the new Covenant are abſolute, and therefore ſure to all the ſeed, even to every one that believeth in Jeſus Chriſt: Theſe are the grounds of hopes the believers have, that the Covenant, and every tittle of it, ſhall be made
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48427:147"/> good to them; but that which doth meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confirm it, is the blood of Chriſt: His death and ſuffering, on which account it may be lookt on as the ſealing and confirming of it, and ſo believers may ſee to whom they are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and oblig'd for all their new-Covenant ſtability.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</label> From this grand and glorious truth: The fulfilling and aſſurance of the new Covenant, flows, 1. Wonderful Comfort to all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. 2. Great Obligations on them to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Obedience.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This yeilds abundant Conſolation to Believers, on a double account.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. From the certainty.</item>
                  <item>2. From the Excellency of this Covenant.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, From the certainty of this Covenant flows theſe ſtreams of comfort. Firſt, In that all occaſions of Jealouſie about the love of God are cut off; for if the Covenant be ſure, then Gobs love is ſure, and ſecured from all mutability, and ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this being one great thing contained in it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. <hi>I have loved thee with an Everlaſting love.</hi> Gods love to his People is Eternal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſure: He doth reſt in his love to them, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17. The word is <hi>(Jachariſh)</hi> he will be ſilent in his love. <hi>Bucer</hi> renders it <hi>Silebit cum dilecta ſua: He ſhall be ſilent in his Beloved;</hi> that is (ſaith he) He ſhall ceaſe from contending with her, being wholly delighted in her. But <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> renders it in the abſtract, he ſhall be ſilent by reaſon of his love. <hi>Propter dilectionem ſuam.</hi> But <hi>Cocceius</hi> and other Interpreters, render the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48427:148"/> letter <hi>(Beth) In: He ſhall be ſilent in his love,</hi> or reſt in his love, alluding to the wonderful exceſs of affection in a Perſon, that through exceeding amorouſneſs cannot ſpeak or expreſs it for a time: <hi>Cocceius</hi> takes it for the pardoning of their ſin, and ceaſing from thoſe former ſtroaks of his diſpleaſure: And this I ſuppoſe may be chiefly intended here; <hi>to wit,</hi> The greatneſs of his love no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed by ſilence, and exuberant Joy, with a remove of all tokens of his anger, and this to be fixt and perpetual; ſo the Apoſtle aſſures Believers, that the love of God in Chriſt is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. All the World cannot withdraw Chriſts heart from his People, where he once loves he loves to the end, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1. This a believer may be aſſured of in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that Gods love changeth not, his heart is ſtill towards his people, however his dealings may be with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then all the grounds of tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fear are now removed. If the Covenant of grace be confirmed to believers, then there's no Juſt ground for them to entertain ſlaviſh fear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>For ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear.</hi> There's no cauſe for ſuch to fear, 1. That God is their Enemy; being once reconciled to them in his Son, he can hate them no more. 2. Their ſins ſhall never Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. 3. God will never totally leave them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. 4. They ſhall not wholly fall from God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. 5. They have no cauſe to fear the wrath to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Much more being juſtified by his blood we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> Thus you ſee
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48427:148"/> all the grounds of tormenting fears are gone: 'Tis true a Cautelous fear and circumſpection may be maintained, but the workings of a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage-Spirit are removed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then dejecting Concluſions from ſelf-impotency to fulfil this Covenant, and all ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulties in the way are wholly Inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant; if this Covenant be confirmed by Chriſt to and for Believers, then no inſufficiency in them to make good theſe Covenant-Duties can render it void. Becauſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt; the Certainty of this Covenant depends not on the Creatures ability, but on Gods Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; 'tis true, if this new Covenant (as the firſt) did wholly depend upon the Integrity and Faithfulneſs of the Soul in Covenant; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the enjoyment of thoſe mercies and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes comprehended in it would be very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious; but 'tis not ſo, for God himſelf hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the accompliſhment of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>Who ſhall alſo confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; God is faithful by whom ye are called to the fellowſhip of his Son Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> So 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23, 24. So that the Saints Confirmation in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and preſervation to glory depends on the faithfulneſs of God in Chriſt, who having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded their hearts to embrace his call, will finiſh Salvation-work in, and for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Strength ſufficient to finiſh their work, and to obtain Salvation is enſured to them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> Grace in thee may fail, but grace in God cannot: Chriſt
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48427:149"/> hath a ſtock ſufficient for thee, to carry thee through Temptations, and to lift thee above thy Corruptions. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</hi> The Spirit is a Fountain that will fill up your empty veſſels, ſupply all your wants, and engage your hearts to keep the way of his Commandements.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then none of the well-grounded hopes of believers ſhall be loſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 49. <hi>Remember thy word unto thy Servant upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope.</hi> God will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to fulfil thoſe promiſes which he cauſeth us to confide in, for he is faithful who hath promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>And hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> maketh not aſhamed.</hi> That is, by reaſon of a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; ſhame uſually ariſeth from ſome fruſtrations of expectation, but this cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall well-grounded hopes, becauſe they have their dependence upon the firm word of God which cannot be diſappointed.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Then your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord, if the Covenant be confirmed, then you cannot run in vain, or loſe any part of that work you do for God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. <hi>What a man ſoweth that ſhall he reap.</hi> He that ſoweth to the Spirit ſhall reap life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: O Souls, all your ſincere duties will appear again, and bring their reward with them. All your pains in ſerving God, hardſhips in following him, dangers in owning him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious labours to pleaſe him, ſhall be fully and certainly recompenc'd with a far more and exceeding Maſſy Crown of Glory.</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:48427:149"/>
               <p> Sixthly, Then all your warrantable deſires ſhall be ſatisfied in due time: For this is part of the Covenant-promiſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 37. 4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf alſo in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thy heart, Pſalm.</hi> 145. 16, 19. All the breathings of your Souls after God, and unfeigned longings for more ſpotleſs holineſs, more perfect victory over ſin, for humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to divine pleaſure, more ſincerity of heart, and raiſed capacities for ſervice, ſhall certainly be ſatisfied firſt or laſt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If the Covenant of grace be ſure, then nothing can make the believers ſtate miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, indeed he may ſeem to be in a bad condition, when under the power of temptation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and preſſed grievouſly with ſevere and bitter Providences, and ſtroaks of ſeeming ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but yet his ſtate is good; who could have paſt a favourable interpretation on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of <hi>Job,</hi> when on a dunghil, and on the tryals of <hi>David</hi> when purſued by <hi>Abſalom?</hi> yet we find there was hony in theſe Rods, and <hi>David</hi> could notwithſtanding lye down and ſleep in peace, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 3. 5.

               <p>Laſtly, Then a gracious Soul is a bleſſed Soul, both here and to all Eternity, becauſe this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant takes care for the good things of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus we have now briefly toucht on ſome grounds of Comfort that Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may derive from the certainty of this new Covenant; we now come to conſider,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The excellency of this Covenant which the blood of Chriſt ſo confirms to Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; this new Covenant is a choice and precious Covenant; what <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword may be affirmed of this; <hi>That there is none like it,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 9. This would abundantly apear, could I with conſiſtency to my deſign here, run out at large in the demonſtration of this great truth; but to touch a little on ſome evidences of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency under theſe two general conſiderations.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, The things ſtipulated in this Covenant, are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Great and glorious things, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of infinite Grace, and diſcoveries of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable greatneſs, ſuch Promiſes as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offered in any other Covenant: In this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God makes over himſelf to Believers to be their God, their Sun and Shield, their exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great reward, all that he is, and all that he hath to be theirs, ſo far as they are capable to receive: <hi>I will be to them a God;</hi> that's in the Covenant: He whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain; whom the Angels cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, far above the ſearches of the moſt refined Spirits, far beyond the knowledge of thoſe that always dwell in his ſight; this inviſible unknown
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48427:150"/> God in this Covenant makes himſelf over to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: He will be theirs for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. A God in the neareſt Relations that Creatures are capable to approach to him in: He will be a Father, Husband, Head to them, and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: To love and delight in them; to feed and cheriſh them; to care and provide for them; to dwell and abide with them; to impart, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate of all his fullneſs and ſweetneſs to them, ſo far as it ſutes with the meaſure of Chriſt, and their beſt good: Is not this a great thing indeed, that God ſhould make over himſelf to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever? O glorious Covenant!</p>
               <p>Again, Another great and glorious thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this Covenant is, That Believers ſhall be to him a people, a peculiar people; his own people, his Jewel, his Treaſure, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. They ſhall be the Apple of his Eye; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of his Soul, a Seal upon his Heart: <hi>A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple near to God, Pſa.</hi> 148. 14. Nearer to him than all the world beſides; nearer than the Angels, that never ſinned: What a wonderful thing is this! They ſhall be dandled on his knee: Lye in his Boſom; ſit at his Table here; and ſit down on Thrones in his Kingdom to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: O what a wonderful Covenant is this! This ſhould fill the Believers heart brim full of Joy and Conſolation.</p>
               <p>Again, He hath promiſed in this Covenant, that he will write his Law in their Hearts, and put his truth in their inward parts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. They ſhall be his Epiſtle known and read of all men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2, 3. He will lead them into all
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48427:151"/> truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. He will ſhew them his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25. 14. He will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſſes, and remember their ſins no more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. He will put his Spirit within them, and cauſe them to walk in his ways, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. He will give them Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he withold from them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 84. 11. He will admit them into his ſpecial preſence at all times, through the blood of his Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20. He will give them the Spirit of Adoption to cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. They ſhall be Kings and Prieſts to God, cloathed with beautiful Garments, a right noble ſeed all glorious within; and advanc'd into intimate familiarity with God in Chriſt by the Spirit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. They ſhall be kept by his mighty power through Faith to Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 5. O, are not theſe great things indeed for poor ſinful Duſt and Aſhes, mercy-abuſing Creatures! O we want Hearts to contain them, and Tongues to expreſs them.</p>
               <p>Again, As this Covenant is made up of great things, ſo it contains in it all good things, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. All Gods Thoughts and Reſolves, are to do them good; all his diſpenſations are bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. O what a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing is this! Yea they are ſutable things that are wrapt up in this Covenant: Such as are ſutable to their Natures; ſutable to their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual deſires; ſutable to their wants, and ſutable to their advantages: The new Covenant carries nothing Hetrogeneous to the well-being of the Saints: O what a wonderful thing is this! Great things indeed are contain'd in this new-Covenant,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48427:151"/> that tends to the infinite content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pleaſure and profit of ſaved Souls: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this muſt needs fill Believers Joys, and yield them merry days here, and prepare for them Rivers of pleaſure to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the way which God hath appointed for the attaining thoſe glorious things, and this will advance the Believers comfort: Perſons may come at good things in a bad way, and that would abate much of their conſolation: But theſe great and glorious things contain'd in the Covenant of Grace for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, are g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven out in a moſt excellent way: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is in a way of Grace; If God had given them to be bought and ſold, to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by mans merit, it would not have been ſo ſweet: But they are held out freely, without money, without price, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>It is by Grace you are ſaved, not of your ſelves, Eph.</hi> 2. 8. There's nothing for man to glory in, about his Salvation, that is of his own: Saved Souls are created to their mercies: They are prepared for their mercies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. And their mercies are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. They are alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for their Duties, in order to their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: They are Veſſels of mercy fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for mercy and glory, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is in a ſelf-humbling, and abaſing way: The more the Creature is abaſed, the more Divine Glory is exalted; and the more God is all in all, the more is the ſaved Souls Glory, Comfort, and Joy; the more the lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man is brought down, the more God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48427:152"/> is exalted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 17. And the more God is exalted, the more Believers are pleaſed: Now God gives out theſe new-Covenant mercies in ſuch a way, as may moſt abaſe ſelf; for he gives them out in a way of Believing, and no Grace more cuts off ſelf than Believing: All boaſting and Self-glorying is cut off by Believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. Therefore God hath ordered ſuch a way for Souls to come at new-Covenant Mercies, as may cut off all Self glorying, that ſo their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts may riſe to the greateſt meaſure, to be full Joy and Conſolation, to ſee the Creature abaſed, and God exalted: There's nothing but Man's curſed ſelf can indeed prove a real Enemy to his comforts: A Child of God is never more filled with the pure Wine of Conſolation, than when he is emptied of all the Lees and Dregs of his own vain-glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is in a pure and clean way, that God brings ſaved Souls to theſe new-Covenant mercies: It is in a way of Holineſs: No uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed ſhall paſs therein: It is in that way of Grace, and Purity, without which none ſhall ſee the Lord: It is the upright, pure in Heart, the ſincere Soul ſhall attain to theſe great and glorious things: The clean Hands, and the clean Heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 140. 13. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is in a ſweet and pleaſant way: A delighful way, for ſuch are all the ways of Holineſs to gracious Souls, ſweeter than Hony <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd the Hony-comb: They take wonderful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leaſure in Holineſs, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. 17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17. Legal ways were hard and troubleſome ways.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48427:152"/> The Yoke of the Law is a heavy Yoke, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. But the Yoke of Chriſt is an eaſie Yoke, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 30. O that God ſhould confirm ſuch a Covenant as this, that contains ſuch glorious things, and all theſe enſured to Believers, and they led to them in ſuch a choice way; ſurely this muſt needs yield wonderful comfort, and advance the Believers Joy.</p>
               <p>Another improvement of this grand truth is by way of Duty.</p>
               <p>There's nothing more ſtrengthens the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Bond to Obedience, than the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the certainty of the new-Covenant: Not to mention all thoſe arguments that might be urged to engage Redeemed Souls to all manner of Holineſs from the certainty of the Covenant: I ſhall inſiſt only on theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The conſideration of that Infinite Love of Chriſt, that led him through ſuch a coſtly way to make good this Covenant: O what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Love is this, if duly weighed? That the Son of God ſhould come down, and be made man, take upon him the form of a Servant; engage to the Service of the firſt Covenant, to make good all the violated conditions thereof by his ſufferings, and all the precepts thereof by his Obedience: That he ſhould be made a Curſe, and taſte of death, and all to make this Covenant ſure: That he ſhould ſhed his blood, to make firm this Covenant in all the parts of it: That he ſhould come and melt himſelf to death, that the ſeal might be put upon this new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. O what wonderful Love is this, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could make it ſure, but the Teſtatours
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48427:153"/> blood, and that he would ſhed his Blood to make it ſure. Now then there's no greater conſtraints to duty, than the ſenſe of the Love of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>The Love of Chriſt conſtrains us.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Love are irreſiſtible; it ſilences the Believing Soul in all his reſiſtances: When Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fetch'd from the Law, do only drive the Soul to Duty; nay ſometimes bind back from duty: That at ſuch a time the ſenſe of the Love of Chriſt doth draw, yea poſt the Soul away to Obedience, <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee, Cant.</hi> 1. 4. that is, Let out the potent influences of thy ſweet Love upon me, and then I will haſten after thee, or further my Obedience of thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another reaſon for Obedience is taken from the certain bleſſed Ends, and Fruit of new-Covenant Obedience, which is no leſs than Eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. All the bleſſings of the everlaſting Covenant are enſured to ſuch, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103. 17, 18. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him; to ſuch as keep his Covenant, to them that remember his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to do them:</hi> Mercies in the way, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the end, are all enſured to them that fear him, to them that Evangelically keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25. 10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth, unto ſuch as keep his Covenant and his Teſtimonies.</hi> There's great reward in the very keeping his Commandements, and reward in the latter end: O what promiſes are entail'd to Goſpel-Obedience: Nay, you will not only have the Fruit of your own Graces, but you will have the Fruit of Chriſts Grace, the Fruit of his Obedience, and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48427:153"/> too: Therefore, O what reaſon have ſuch to obey! ſeeing the Covenant is made ſure, they cannot miſcarry, their labour ſhall not be loſt; conſidering the Love of God, that ſhould engage them to Obedience, and the bleſſed Iſſue of it.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the ſixth Branch, and <hi>Item</hi> of Chiſt's Inventory, and the Riches of his Purchaſe.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WE ſhall briefly add one particular more of the Purchaſe of Chriſt, that is, The Conſummation, and compleating of all the Believers happineſs, and comprehenſion of his chiefeſt treaſure, which is the purchaſed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Glory, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the purchaſed Poſſeſſion, unto the praiſe of his Glory:</hi> that is, unil we come to inherit this glory purchaſed by Chriſt: O what a bleſſing is this! All that have been treated of already, are but little parcels of this total ſum of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers happineſs: O when the whole treaſury of Chriſt ſhall be opened, and ſet forth to the view and enjoyment of ſaved Souls: When all Chriſt's perſonal Glory, as Mediator, ſhall be diſcovered to them, and become their Glory; when all his purchaſed Glory for them alſo, ſhall then be entred on by them; all that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48427:154"/> for himſelf, and all he hath procured for them, ſhall all be made over to them; This will be a bleſſed Eternity indeed; when their Crowns of Maſſy Glory ſhall be ſet upon their heads, and when they alſo ſhall be ſet down upon Thrones of dignity, honoured with the reflections of Chriſts Majeſty, and unconceivable grandure. This is a myſtery indeed, but a real truth to all Believers: O bleſſed purchaſe indeed! who can tell over this ſum, when the Saints ſhall be ſo enriched with the Riches of Chriſt, cloathed with the beautiful Garments of his praiſe? O wonderful Glory indeed! Deckt with the Jewels of the Graces of his Spirit; and fill'd with his holineſs brim full: When they ſhall be ſatiated with his pleaſures, but never tyred; ſit down at the Well head, and drink full draughts of pleaſure; Take in their fill of the higheſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and unknown Sweetneſs, Love, and delight from Chriſt. O this muſt needs be wonderful enriching! when they be, ever, ever, ever with the Lord; where no clouds can dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their ſights, of their bleſſed manſion, and their bleſſed God; where no vail can intervene between them and their Beloved: Where Ruſt, Moth, Worms, Time, and Death can never come to wear out their enjoyments: O bleſſed Treaſure indeed! Where Eternity ſhall be the Date, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity the Bounds, and Immutability the fixation of their happineſs. But ſo it ſhall be with ſaved Souls in Heaven, when they are got through the Sea of Chriſt's blood to Glory. O Believers, Do not your hearts leap within you? What no kind of affection at all to theſe things? Is all this as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48427:154"/> a dream to you? Where are your Hearts? O be affected at this wonderful bleſſedneſs Chriſt hath procured in Heaven for you. O bleſſed, bleſſed Eternity! where ſaved Souls ſhall wear a Crown, that fadeth not away; where their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands ſhall be ever freſh and green; their joys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver new; and their enjoyments never wearing; where all their ſown ſeed of Spiritual-Duties and Goſpel-ſufferings, ſhall ſpring up to Glory, to a full crop of bleſſedneſs, to an harveſt of pleaſure, proportionable to all the Love of God to them; to the utmoſt meaſures of their Graces, and acts of their Faithfulneſs; the large extent of divine promiſes, yea ſuited to the infinite deſervings of Chriſt for his ſaved ones, Glory, as much as can be claimed: This will ſet forth the Treaſures of Chriſt to be boundleſs, bottomleſs, endleſs, without all circumference; higher then all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, broader than all Latitude, deeper then all profunditude: O treaſures indeed! Saints and Angels may look into them, but can never ſee the bottom: In compariſon of which Riches in Heaven, all the warmeſt Apprehenſions, all the ſweeteſt taſtes, all the higheſt enjoyments of Saints here, are no more than a drop to the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; like one ear of Corn compar'd with all the fields in the world, cloath'd with fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; No more then a ſingle Duſt, to all the Beds of Sand in the whole Sea. O what is glory! Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are theſe Jewels ſo valuable, that you can bear about with you here? O what a Cabinet then is Heaven? O what are the Treaſures laid up there! O wonderful large indeed! Weigh the utmoſt pleaſures, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48427:155"/> delighting, raviſhing conſolations that all the Believers in the World can get by this ſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all the graces, all the Joys of all the Saints in the World put together, compar'd with glory, is no more than a ſingle grain to a Maſſy weight of Glory: O 'tis that which Men and Angels cannot expreſs: All that Believers have here of Heaven, it is but as Bread and Water in the way, the choiceſt and richeſt feaſting is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for the other World, for the Kings Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where are all Varieties, all Rich Diſhes, all the choice Procurements, that may feed and ſatiate the moſt curious deſires of ſaved Souls: Doſt thou meet with high Comforts at a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? wonderful refreſhings in Ordinances? yet they are but a Morſel or two thy Father gives thee to chear thy Spirits, compar'd with the varieties he hath reſerv'd for thee in Heaven: Or as the ſhort allowance of ſome Rich Heir whiles in his Nonage, compar'd with the great Inheritance he is to poſſeſs when at full age; or as the firſt-fruits which are inconſiderable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the lump.

               <p>Thus have I diſpatcht the firſt aſſertion, and ſhewn ſomewhat of thoſe vaſt riches that are in Chriſt; and though ſometime hath been ſpent in opening them, yet it is but little of all thoſe Treaſures, which are prepar'd for them that are Heirs of the Promiſe.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Come now to demonſtrate the truth of the ſecond aſſertion, which is this, <hi>That thoſe vaſt and hidden Treaſures which are found in Jeſus Chriſt, are opened in and by the Goſpel.</hi>

                  </gap>, Shutting up the ſenſes as well as the mouth, it being a thing hard to be known, ſuch a ſecret is the great Power of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt: A religious ſecret (ſaith one) that cannot be known without ſome extraodinary flatus, and ſuch are the riches of Chriſt, hidden things, hid in God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9. The fellowſhip of the Myſtery which from the beginning of the World have been hid in God, and therefore cannot be known by all the wiſdom of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the revelation of the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 3. 5. And therefore it was an unſound aſſertion of Mr. <hi>John Goodwin:</hi> That the Sun and Moon do Preach the Goſpel, ſeeing it cannot be known but by the revelation of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe Treaſures of Chriſt are Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally contain'd in the word of the Goſpel, there's the only diſcovery of them Doctrinally, there's no other word can diſcover them, and thus they are ſet forth, and brought to light, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>But now is made manifeſt by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light by the Goſpel.</hi> There are actually exhibited to the view of Believers, all the myſteries of godlineſs, ſo the Goſpel is called the revelation of the myſtery which is kept ſecret ſince the World began, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. The Goſpel is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48427:156"/> the wiſdom of God that maketh wiſe to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. There are all things open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſary to Salvation: There are words whereby we may be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 4. In the word of truth are all the Propheſies of Chriſt, and of thoſe great and glorious things that God would accompliſh upon and by him, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 18. In the word are all the promiſes of grace and Glory, all things needful to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and theſe promiſes are revealed in the word of God: All the promiſes ever God made to the Sons of Men are in the word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promiſes are joyned with the Law, and the ſervice of God, the glory and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and all thoſe royalties that in Scripture are made over to Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. There's all that God hath ſpoken by the Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25. There's all diſcover'd that ever God Doctrinally revealed of his love to Sinners, and the things that are freely given to them, there's the whole Doctrine of Chriſt concerning his Perſon, Nature, Offices, Works, Excellencies, Promiſes, what he hath done for them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for them; what is laid up in him, and ſhall be laid out by him to all that come to him; there are the openings of his heart, and the ſecrets of his love to them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18, 19. Therein the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. The deep things of God 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 12, 16. Things that eye hath, not ſeen, nor ear heard.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe great and glorious things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Goſpel, are opened by the Spirits Miniſtration in the Goſpel: This is Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48427:157"/> way to diſcover and bring to light thoſe glorious things. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>But hath in due time, manifeſted his word through Preaching, which is committed to me according to the Commandement of God our Saviour:</hi> This is Gods way to manifeſt the deep things of the Word by Preaching: This he hath appointed as a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church through all ages, that ſome ſhould be ſet apart for this work, to open and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the glorious ſecrets of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2, 6, 7. To theſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt reveals his truth, even the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of it by his Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 5. That they might Preach, and open them to others: This way God is pleaſed to work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus he taught the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8. 26. and <hi>Paul</hi> by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, Acts</hi> 9. 11. and <hi>Cornelius</hi> by <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10. 5.</p>
               <p>3. Aſſertion. <hi>It is the will of God that thoſe great and glorious Treaſures of Chriſt in the Goſpel ſhould be opened and tendred to Sinners, yea to the chiefeſt of Sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is as certain, as choice a truth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious news to ſinners. For the demonſtration of which, I ſhall, 1. Prove <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by four argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 2. The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by four reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is really true, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is willing that all thoſe unſearchable Treaſures of his ſhould be tendred to Sinners, yea the chiefeſt of Sinners.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt's willingneſs to ſhed his blood for Sinners, ſhews he is willing his Treaſures ſhould be opened and tendered to them: He that gives the cauſe, gives the effect, <hi>Cauſa Cauſae, eſt</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:48427:157"/> 
                  <hi>Cauſa Cauſati;</hi> Chriſts blood is the procuring cauſe of all thoſe Treaſures that are purchaſed for Believers; and that which gives a right to his perſonal riches too, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7, 11. Now if Chriſt be willing to give his blood for believers to procure thoſe Treaſures, then ſurely he is willing to have them opened and tendered to them, he that wills the means to the end, wills the end too: Should not Chriſt be willing that his riches ſhould be opened and tenderd to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it would lay a great reflection on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in dying for Sinners, and leave the charge of unfaithfulneſs on truth it ſelf; which how unjuſt it is let all that are rational judge; but it is for ſinners Chriſt hath ſhed his blood, yea for the chiefeſt of ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>In due time Chriſt dyed for the ungodly:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 'Tis the ſame word the Apoſtle uſeth to expreſs the people before the flood by, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. Now what theſe were <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. Ignorance, Prophaneſs, Contempt of God, and the vileſt abominations were committed by thoſe whom Chriſt came to redeem, yet to theſe would he have the Goſpel ſent, and his Treaſures opened and tendred.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His appointing and ſending a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry on purpoſe to Preach the Goſpel to ſinners proves it: This was the firſt thing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did when he aſcended on high, he gave gifts to Men, that of Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers; and why was this? it was for the work of the Miniſtry, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12. And what is the work of the Miniſtery? Why to open and Preach Chriſt
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48427:158"/> Crucified to the World, to diſcover reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-mercy, and all the Treaſures of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd therein, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 21. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me ſo ſend I you:</hi> Now if the Lord Jeſus ſets apart a Miniſtery on purpoſe to attend this work, as <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 4. Then ſurely he is willing Sinners ſhould have thoſe riches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and tender'd to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The choice annointings he gives them to this end, evidenceth his willingneſs the Goſpel ſhould be Preached, and his Treaſures o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the World; as the Father hath annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and given the Spirit without meaſure to him, ſo hath he annointed his Meſſengers with meaſures of the Spirit for this work, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 11. <hi>But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal:</hi> That is the gifts of the Spirit by a Metonymy of the effect; and given to every one to whom it is given, for this end to profit withal (ſo <hi>Piſcator)</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Apoſtle ſpeaks here of gifted Perſons in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> whether they were ordinary or extraordinary Teachers, they had all choice gifts imparted to them by the Spirit to that end: All whom Chriſt ſends to Preach the Goſpel have the annointings of his Spirit to fit them for that work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 4. <hi>The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I ſhould know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary: The Prophet here</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin) doth perſonate all the Miniſters of Chriſt in all ages.</hi> And tells us that all thoſe Chriſt ſends to Preach the Goſpel, he doth give ſutable endowments to them for that end; he doth impart his truth to them by his Spirit that they might teach others:
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48427:158"/> This is the Reaſon Chriſt gives the Spirit of his Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 20. He makes them teachable, that they might teach others: Hence <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non bonus eſt Doctor qui non eſt docilis:</hi> Chriſt reveals thoſe treaſures of his to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that they might open them to others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 8. <hi>Freely ye have received freely give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The charge he lays upon his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, demonſtrates this truth, he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to go and preach the Goſpel to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. 'Tis an Hyberboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Synecdoche of the genus, <hi>Every Creature put for all Nations,</hi> ſaith <hi>Piſcator.</hi> The word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is committed to them as to Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, faithfully to impart it to thoſe they are ſent to: There's a neceſſity laid upon them to preach the Goſpel, and a wo if they do not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>A neceſſity, not of Coaction, but Obligation, and divine command,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paraeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, why Chriſt is ſo willing thoſe Treaſures ſhould be tender'd to Sinners.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſo he might give the world a proof of the greatneſs of his Love to periſhing Sinners, and of the largeneſs of his bowels to poor mankind, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>To make all men ſee what is the Fellowſhip of the myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. Now what was the fellowſhip of this myſtery? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>That the Gentiles ſhould be Fellow-heirs, and of the ſame body, and partakers of his promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel.</hi> This ſets forth the wonderful love of God in Chriſt to fallen man; that God is willing the myſtery of Salvation ſhould be opened to ſuch vile Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the Gentiles were; worſhippers of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48427:159"/> and Devils, ſuch unclean and filthy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the chiefeſt of ſinners, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3. Such were all before Converſion, they had fellowſhip with Devils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20. And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the love of God indeed, that he ſhould reveal Jeſus Chriſt to the vileſt ſinners, and tells the world it is by Grace any are ſaved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. and of the riches of mercy, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6. It lets ſinners know that God is no reſpecter of perſons, he ſaves none for any worth in them, but for his great love in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the worſt of ſinners might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to come to Chriſt, and none be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Salvation but thoſe that exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37. This is Chriſts deſign thereby to draw ſinners to himſelf by the ſavour of his Oyntments, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 32. O the precious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of his excellencies are attractive; the riches of Chriſt, and the Glory of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have a wonderful influence to perſwade ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 15. A ſeen and believed bleſſedneſs in the ways of Chriſt, will make the Soul part with all for him, and come on any terms to the enjoyment of it: Terrours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Souls affections to God, but mercy and the excellency of Chriſt doth conſtrain them; now Chriſt is willing that every loſt ſinner that ſees and believes in him ſhould be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That ſo all his Elect that lye among the periſhing world might thereby be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 16. The Election muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though the reſt be blinded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt cannot loſe one Soul the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48427:159"/> hath given him, they muſt come in firſt or laſt; and for their ſakes, as the evil-days are ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 22. ſo ſhall the Goſpel-days be continued till Chriſt hath gathered all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect into union with himſelf from the four winds, even as many as are ordained to Life: Now there's no ſuch way to fetch in Souls to Chriſt, as by opening thoſe Treaſures.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That they who periſh under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel might be left without excuſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. They have nothing to plead againſt damnation, who deſpiſe ſo great Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. And turn their backs on ſuch tendered bleſſedneſs: To leave tryed Gold for Counters, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for Trifles, the portion of Saints for the pleaſures of ſin, is utterly inexcuſable; and this is one reaſon of Chriſts opening his Treaſures to the world, 'tis to juſtifie his ſeverity againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, that will not come to him that they may have life; he will have every mouth ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the whole world of unbelieving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners become guilty before him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. Thus have I diſpatch'd the third Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>I now come to make Application of the whole.</p>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48427:160"/> in Earthen Veſſels: The Lord commits them to us, that we may open them, and make a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them to periſhing ſinners, according to his order. Our buſineſs is to preach Chriſt, and open the treaſures of Chriſt, with all his vaſt Inheritance to every Soul that receives him: O then the ſingular happineſs they have, that have the word of this Grace ſent to them: Oh what a mercy is it to live within the day-ſpring from on high, and under the joyful found: To hear the good news of a Saviours being born, and offer'd to periſhing Souls: To have the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of thoſe Soul-enriching overtures; O think upon the blind periſhing world, that live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Line of Communication, with whom Free-Grace holds no correſpondence about Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> that live without the Goſpel, and then reflect upon the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges you enjoy, and ſee what a mercy this is; and then ſay, who hath made you to differ; O why ſhould the Sun ſhine on your borders, and the day ſpring from on high viſit your coaſts; leaving others to periſh without regarding? O is it not Grace that God ſhould viſit you with the Goſpel, and ſuffer others to perſecute it? O theſe are the motions of Sovereign pleaſure, and the paths of diſtinguiſhing mercy: O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! how much are you indebted to this free unſearchable Grace, that ſhould paſs by ſo many parts of the World, and pitch on this little ſpot of ground?

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48427:161"/> ſhould come, and ſtand over you. O little do you know what it is to lye in darkneſs, and in the Region and ſhadow of Death: O! this ſhould cauſe you to value the Goſpel: who can tell but they that feel it, what it is to be ſhut up in the Region of death, and be bound in chains of darkneſs; to lye in a waſt howling Wilderneſs, where there is none to guide their feet in the way of peace: O what a ſad judgment is this! O Souls! If ever you live to ſee, the light put out, and the Miniſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel gone from <hi>England,</hi> then you will know what doleful miſeries are; and will you not prize the Goſpel then, that is ſuch a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mercy, beyond all your Eſtates, and all the enjoyments of the whole world? How will ſome men value thoſe Sciences that feed their natural minds with knowledge, and feaſt their Rational deſires with diſcoveries of ſome unknown Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And will not you love the Goſpel, that brings to light the glorious truths of Chriſt? How will Tradeſmen prize the Rules of their Arts, that make them skilful! How will the Worldlings hug thoſe Counſels that help to make them rich!

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48427:162"/> to keep the Goſpel, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 23. <hi>Buy the Truth, and ſell it not:</hi> Lay out any thing to enjoy the Goſpel; part with your Luſts, part with your Treaſures; let all go, ſo you may keep the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: But then do not ſell it: O the Goſpel is Treaſure enough, count nothing too dear for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Teſtifie your valuation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: By your willingneſs to part with all, or any thing, if God call you to it for the Goſpel: Doth God bid you pluck out a right eye, cut off a right hand, let it go if God call for it: Doth he call for your liberty, your lives for the Goſpels ſake, let them go, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. O Souls! be not like the <hi>Gadarens</hi> to value your Swine above the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and rather let the Goſpel go, than part with a little of your Eſtates, <hi>Luke,</hi> 8. 37.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſtians, ſhew your high eſteem of the Goſpel, by your readineſs to attend it at all times: To run at every call of the Goſpel, with <hi>Mary</hi> to ſit at Chriſts feet, though other things be out of order, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 39, 40. Will not you part with a little of your buſineſs, and let your Plow ſtand ſtill awhile, to attend upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel? O Chriſtians! ſhew your prizings of the Goſpel, by your willingneſs to ſit down under it at all times.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Shew your high eſteem of the Goſpel, by the greateſt improvements of it while you have it; Sirs, you cannot tell how ſoon it may be taken from you, or you from it; you ſee what attempts are made againſt the Goſpel, you have reaſon then to make the moſt of it while you have it: Chriſt gives this argument to his hearers to prize it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 35. <hi>Yet a little while is the light</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:48427:163"/> 
                  <hi>with you, walk while you have the light, leſt darkneſs come upon you:</hi> Be ſure at the beſt, 'tis but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time you ſhall have it, if you live out all your time under the Goſpel, till your glaſs be run e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very duſt, 'tis but a little while you ſhall ſit under the dews of this <hi>Hermon hill;</hi> the time of your life is but a little while; the time of your digging in this Mine is but a little while, Death will draw the Curtain, and ſet you beyond the droppings of theſe dews and golden Oyls: O then improve the Goſpel while you have it; make the moſt of it, get all the good you can from it, by way of illumination, inſtruction, Correction, Faith and Conſolation: Chriſtians, get your heads and hearts fill'd with this precious ſubſtance what you can; this will be your wiſdom, you will find it ſo when you come to reckoning: O fill theſe Chambers of your Souls with precious treaſures; lay up thoſe choice fruits that may laſt you in your Winter Days: Get the kowledge of Chriſt, and the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt more and more, while you may come under the news of it: O draw hard at theſe breaſts, that you may get much food and nouriſhment for your Souls, that may ſerve you many a day.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Shew your high valuation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by your believing in it, by your loving and obeying of it: <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 36. <hi>While you have the light believe in the light:</hi> Thoſe friends we value much, we truſt much. Souls if you value the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, you will believe it: The Goſpel tells you; <hi>He that hath the Son hath life; he that hath not the Son hath not life: It tells you, he that lives after the fleſh ſhall dye:</hi> O believe it! the Goſpel ſaies, <hi>If you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:48427:163"/> 
                  <hi>your evil ways, you ſhall have mercy; if you hold faſt your ſins you ſhall dye:</hi> It tells you, <hi>you cannot come at Salvation, but in Salvations wayes:</hi> O believe the Goſpel; <hi>they that know thy Name will put their truſt in thee, Pſa.</hi> 9. 10. If you did but know the worth and truth of it, you would believe it, you may hang all the weight of your Souls upon the Line of the Goſpel, you may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture your immortal Souls upon the promiſes of the Goſpel: It will bear all your weights, then love the Goſpel: <hi>Love the truth and peace, Zach.</hi> 8. 19. Is the Goſpel ſuch a good Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that brings you ſuch good news, and will you not love it? O Souls! love the Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel. And then obey the Goſpel: If you love Chriſt indeed you will keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. you will obey his voice. This argues your eſteem of the Goſpel, when you follow the inſtructions it gives you. Doth God bid you forſake your evil wayes? Come and cloſe with Chriſt? O! obey thoſe Counſels he gives you in his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Shew your high valuation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by holding forth a Converſation ſutable to it, <hi>Only let your Converſation be as becometh the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 1. 27. As if he ſhould ſay, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is the main and ſum of all O! live wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Then is your Converſation as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Goſpel, when you live as becomes the grace of God diſcover'd in the Goſpel: 'Tis infinite grace is revealed in it; you ſhould walk ſo as to honour grace; you ſhould preſs after more grace in your Converſations, there ſhould be
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48427:164"/> grace in every ſtep of your lives, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 1, 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then you live ſutable to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when you live up to thoſe great and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things held out in it: When the Goſpel is opened there are choice Jewels brought forth to ſale: O moſt excellent things produc'd by it, and you ſhould live up ſutable to theſe.</p>
               <p>There's the manifold Wiſdom of God held forth in the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. Treaſures of wonderful wiſdom are opened in the Goſpel: O live up to theſe myſteries: O Chriſtians, let your lives be exact, for you have curious eyes to look upon you, labour to hold forth much wiſdom and much light in your Converſations.</p>
               <p>In the Goſpel is held forth the myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Great is the myſtery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> O what myſteries are here! <hi>God Manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fleſh;</hi> God, and yet cloath'd in fleſh: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for ſin, and yet <hi>juſtified in the Spirit; ſeen of Angels:</hi> Preached to the Geutiles, the worſt of Sinners in the World: Now live ſutable to the myſteries of Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Again, the Goſpel opens the glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Saints, of every ſaved Soul: O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful priviledges! That Enemies ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and ſtrangers made nigh, that Rebels ſhould be adopted Sons and Daughters, made the Children of God by Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16, 17. O what a glorious priviledge is this Believing Souls are brought into by the Goſpel! to a ſtate of Adoption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. A ſtate of glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. O live up to theſe glorious priviledges: <hi>You are Children of the light, walk as Children of the light, Eph.</hi> 5. 8. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48427:164"/> ſhews you the the things freely given of God, the infinite love of God, the wonderful Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Grace of God: O then you live ſutable to the Goſpel, when you live up to thoſe great and glorious things held forth in it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then are your lives according to the Goſpel, when they are ſuted to the Rules of the Goſpel, look what the Goſpel commands; and requires that you do, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20. Now the Goſpel requires not only Bodily, but Spiritual worſhip; to worſhip God in the Spirit: It requires not only external duties, but internal holineſs: It calls for Obedience flowing from love, and labours ſpringing from faith; well prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled duties, when you endeavour the greateſt ſtrickneſs in your lives; That's ſutable to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then is your Converſation as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Goſpel; when it is Subordinate to the ends of it.</p>
               <p>One end of the Goſpel is to exalt the praiſe of the glory of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 12. To make you veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Mercy, for the glory of Mercy: O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians live ſo as you may moſt advance the glory of grace, live ſelf-denyingly and humbly, exclude boaſting, then you live as becomes the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Another great end of the Goſpel is the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſaved Souls, to make Souls holy, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. Then you live as becometh the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when you carry on Goſpel holineſs, inward Holineſs, outward Holineſs, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>The Salvation of Souls, that's another great end of the Goſpel, that the Promiſe may be ſure to all the ſeed, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. That he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48427:165"/> in Chriſt may have Everlaſting Life: O then live as you may be ſaved; you muſt tread upon the World you have ſo much doted upon; you muſt account all things loſs and dung for Chriſt, if ever you be ſaved: O Chriſtians, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then to hold forth a Converſation ſutable to the Goſpel. So much for the firſt Inference.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If ſuch great and unſearchable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are opened and tendered to Sinners in the Goſpel: O then how great is their ſin that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and perſecute the Preaching of it: O this is a black ſin indeed; this activity comes from the Spirit of darkneſs. O 'tis a dreadful thing to oppoſe, reſiſt, and perſecute the Miniſtery of the Goſpel: For ſuch do all they can to hinder the tenders of unſearchable Riches to the World; they labour to keep the World poor, to hinder the Salvation of Souls: And is not this ſad work?</p>
               <p>Again, ſuch as oppoſe and perſecute the Goſpel, are of the curſed brood and off-ſpring of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who do ſhut up the Kingdom of God, and neither enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer them that are entring to go in: So do thoſe that do oppoſe and perſecute the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and would put out the light of the Goſpel; they are the Children of the Devil; the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of Hell; they do their Fathers work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 41, 44. They that hate the light are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil; their deeds are evil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20. They carry the Devils mark upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; wherever they go up and down, to ſay there goes the Devils Children, there goes an Heir of Hell.</p>
               <p>Again, They are Soul murtherers; they do
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48427:165"/> hunt Souls, and ſhed the blood of Souls, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 30. As well as they that hinder the Goſpel of Life, as they that bring in falſe Doctrines, and feed perſons with Lies, and occaſion death: They that ſtarve mens Souls as well as they that poyſon them, both are Soul murtherers. They ſight againſt Chriſt in Heaven: They go up and down with drawn Swords pointed againſt Chriſt in Heaven. O bloody wretches! that have murthered Chriſt on Earth, and now would kill him in Heaven too, <hi>Acts.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Saul, Saul, Why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> O Souls! 'tis a fearful thing to oppoſe and perſecute the Miniſtery of the Goſpel; for all the blood of all the Saints, from the beginning of the world to this day, ſhall be upon their heads, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 35. O 'tis a ſad thing to lye under the blood of one perſon; but to have all the blood of all the Saints in the world to lye upon the head of a poor Creature: O what will that Soul do? That Soul will go to Hell with a vengeance, and lye tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under the wrath of God to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Thus much of the Second Inference.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing the poor and lamentable State of all Chriſtleſs Souls.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF there are ſuch vaſt and unſearchable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in Chriſt, tendered to ſinners in the Goſpel: Hence ſee then the poor and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48427:166"/> ſtate of all thoſe Souls that are without Chriſt. O they are very beggerly Souls that are Chriſtleſs Souls: As they that are far from the Sun, muſt needs be far from Light and Heat; ſo they that are far from Chriſt, muſt needs be far from true Riches: He that hath not a Title to the Field, hath none to the Treaſure that lies in it: <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life, he that hath not the Son hath not Life.</hi> The Character of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is the complexion of all Chriſtleſs Souls: <hi>They are Wretched, Miſerable, Poor, Blind, and Naked,</hi> Rev. 3. 17. <hi>They are aliens from the Common Wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſtrangers to the Covenant of promiſe, without God, and without hope, Eph.</hi> 2. 12. They have none of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, or purchaſed treaſures to enrich them: They have no right to his Perſon, and ſo none to his Excellency: His glorious Attributes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no good at all to them. His moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſweet diſpoſitions, beſpeaks little comfort to them: What Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, imports no advantage to them: Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinners are like beggers, or like poor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhut out of the Rich mans door, that have Charity lock'd up from them; till they come to Chriſt, neither himſelf nor his is theirs; they have not any part of his fulneſs: No Treaſures of Juſtification, Pardon, and Peace, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them: No Riches of Sanctification are made over to them: No Treaſures of Grace, or Glory, are the Unbelievers intereſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt needs be a pitiful poor Soul: Yea, all the Symptoms of Poverty are upon Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinners. To name a few of them.</p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:48427:166"/>
               <p> Firſt, A poor Perſon is a very needy perſon: He is full of wants; ever and anon in diſtreſs, and extremities; always deſtitute: Poor and needy are Synonimous terms, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 17. <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek Water.</hi> So it is with Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Souls, their neceſſities are many; their wants are more than can be numbred: They want Wiſdom, Light, Grace, Glory, every good thing: Nothing truly good is imparted to them: Their unbelief mars all the mercies given to them: <hi>To the unbelieving Soul every thing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, defiled,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. Their unregeneracy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturns all their mercies. Ah! They want eyes to ſee what is lacking in them, and hence 'tis they go up and down ſo ſecure: They want Eyes to ſee, Ears to hear, a mouth to ſpeak, Legs to go, and Hands to Labour: they want Life, and every good thing: And being Aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtrangers to the Covenant of promiſe, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Life of God; muſt needs be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably poor.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Poor Perſons as they are needy, and their wants great, ſo they have nothing of their own to ſupply them: A poor man may want Bread; but his Cupboard doth not afford it: He may ſee his wants, but hath no money in his purſe, no treaſure to repair them; they are poor that have no Eſtates; no Barns-floar to go to; no Lands, no Livings, no money to help them in time of ſtraits: Chriſtleſs Souls are in this ſenſe poor alſo: They have nothing to ſupply their wants, to relieve them in their neceſſities: Their own Treaſures are totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48427:167"/> by ſin: Where the fountain is ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Ciſterns are dry: When the Creator will not help, the Creature cannot, Angels cannot, will not help: Scriptures can impart no comfort to them, whiles out of Chriſt: Where Chriſt ſhuts his door, no good thing gets out to ſuch Souls: They are naked of all thoſe advantages that might enrich them, ſtript of thoſe Conſolations that might chear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them: <hi>Where ſhall we go?</hi> ſays the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 68. So may poor ſinners ſay: <hi>Where ſhall we go?</hi> they are like the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that ſate without the Gate of <hi>Samaria,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Famiſh, and knew not what to do, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 3. This is the caſe of Chriſtleſs Souls: They may have of the fat things of this Life; but not a jot of the Everlaſting hills reacheth them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Poor men uſually fare hard; they are much ſtraitned in their refreſhments; they feed on mean things, very low dyet; Bread and Water is great chear with them: When the Prophet was reduc'd to a ſtate of poverty, he was fed with Bread and Water, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes worſe fare; as the Prodigal fed on Husks; nay, glad to have it, he looked for ſome that would give it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 16. Nay, ſometimes feed upon Doves dung; yea their own fleſh, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 25. O the mean, hard fare poor perſons are brought to in a ſtate of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they go many times with hungry Bellies: Poor people ſometimes with <hi>Lazarus</hi> would be glad of the Crumbs that fall from rich mens Tables, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 21. Such is the ſtate of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48427:167"/> Chriſtleſs Souls; their fare is bad, and very courſe: They live upon the Carrion, the ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Excrements of ſin; They feed upon their Luſts; their ſweeteſt draughts are (with <hi>Darius)</hi> dirty Waters: As the Children of God feed on holineſs, 'tis meat and drink to do their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will; ſo the pleaſures of ſin are the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſweet-meats of Chriſtleſs Souls: The forbidden Fruit is the beſt chear ſuch have: No Tree in the garden pleaſeth them ſo well as the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil. O ſuch is the meat and drink of ſinners, they feed upon their own dung; yea, they are fed with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiles Saints eat the dainties, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fat things of Chriſts Table: They eat the Bone, when the Children feed on the Fleſh: Sinners come to Ordinances, and eat up Bran, whiles the Children feed upon the fineſt of the Wheat; they have but the ſhell and outſide of Ordinances, when gracious Souls eat the kernel and inſide ſweetneſs: The Friends of Chriſt feed upon hidden Manna, when ſinners fill their ſtomachs with husks, yea, gravel: The appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt yield no ſweetneſs to them: Their Ear doth not try words, their Palate hath loſt its taſte; it cannot difference ſweet Waters from bitter; the Language of <hi>Canaan</hi> from the language of <hi>Aſhdod:</hi> Inſtitutions from Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: 'Tis all one to them what is preached: The pure ſtrains of Goſpel truths is no other to them; than the dull methods of dead preaching, juicy meat and dry Bones is all alike to them; O they are poor indeed that fare ſo hard; If Hypocrites feed on any thing 'tis but a dream;
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48427:168"/> if they have comforts, 'tis but ſtollen Waters, when they awake they are empty ſtill: Let the fare be never ſo nouriſhing, the choiceſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they prove not by; they are ill favour'd Souls, and look gaſtly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Poor Men have uſually mean cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts low eſtate in the World was ſet forth by his habit, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 6. <hi>And</hi> John <hi>was cloathed with Camels Hair, and with the gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a skin about his Loynes:</hi> A plain and ſordid habit, as <hi>Calvin</hi> calls it: <hi>Ab omni urbano nitore &amp; lautitiis remotis:</hi> A man far from a Court-like neatneſs, either in habit or apparel, but in a poor and ruſtick attire; not but that <hi>John</hi> might have been better cloathed; he was the Son of <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Prieſt, but taking on him the ſtate of Poverty, he cloathed himſelf accordingly: Poor Men are badly clad, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 19. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they go in rags, as <hi>Soloman</hi> ſaies, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>Drowſineſs will cloath a man in rags:</hi> It notes the Poverty that ſlothful Perſons are brought into; when <hi>James</hi> would diſcribe a poor man, he ſets him forth as cloath'd in vile rayment, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>And there come in a poor man in vile rayment,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, dirty baſe cloaths: The ſame word that is rendred filthly garments, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 3. Is the dreſs of poor men: So Chriſtleſs Souls are very poor, they go in mean rayment, they are naked; the Spirit of God tells the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18. Till Souls be cloathed with the white rayment of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, they be naked, and their ſhame appears; they have nothing to cover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs from the ſight of God, Angels, and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48427:168"/> Saints: They go in poor rayment; their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are webs of their own weaving, and their works are their covering. They are cloath'd with ſhame, and cover'd with Confuſion as with a Mantle, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 109. 29. O what ſad rayment do Sinners go in! Saints are cloathed with white Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beautiful through Chriſts comelineſs; adorn'dwith his Graces, beſpangled in his Jewels; they go up and down in rich Attire: But ſinners lye in ſordid attire, cloath'd with vile Rayment.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Poor men uſually have but bad Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; They commonly live in mean Houſes; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cottages: They ſometimes dwell in the duſt, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 113. 7. <hi>He raiſeth the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribes a poor man, as one that is caſt out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 7. <hi>The poor that be caſt out:</hi> O their Loding is hard; they do not ſpread themſelves on Beds of lvory; nor lye on Cloth of Tapeſtry: The rich have their ceiled Houſes, fair dwellings. The poor many times their Cottages are in a Wilderneſs, and Houſes that drop through. So 'tis with Chriſtleſs Souls; they have poor Lodgings; when Saints Lodge in the boſom of Chriſt, they lye in the Arms of Devils: They lie upon Thorns; yea, Spears, that will pierce them thorough: They lye upon Stones; the Earth is their Bed, they are Earthy Souls, and lodge in the very boſome of the world: They dwell in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of cruelty; they lye in Graves: So the Prophet, when he ſpeaks of the <hi>Jews</hi> dead in ſin before Coverſion, he deſcribes them to be in their Graves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 12. Dead ſinners lye
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48427:169"/> like <hi>Lazarus,</hi> bound with a Napkin in their Graves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 44. O there's your Bed Souls, if out of Chriſt; there you lye kept till the day of Judgment; held Priſoners till a call comes to bring you to the Bar of Chriſt. O your lodging is mean indeed! Saints dwell in God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 91. 1, 9. their habitation is in the City of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. But all Chriſtleſs ſinners lye without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Devils; they dwell on pinacles, and live upon the borders of death every moment, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Dogs, amongſt the unclean O ſee their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and the place where their honour dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. <hi>Without are dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murtherers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh alye.</hi> Theſe are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Chriſtleſs Souls lodge with: they are turn'd out of doors: O ſad, doleful ſtate indeed!</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Another Character of a poor man is this: Poor men are Friendleſs, <hi>Pro.</hi> 19. 4 <hi>Wealth maketh many friends, but the poor is ſeparated from his Neighbour.</hi> Every man ſeeketh the Rulers Favour; every mans Cap, and Hand, and Knee, and all is for them; But the poor man, his very Neighbour comes now to leave him, who was his Friend whiles in proſperity: When Rich men ſit down in places of Honour, poor men muſt ſtand at the Feet, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 3. They are ſure to find few Friends to own them, to pity, and help them! So Chriſtleſs Souls are friendleſs; they have no true Friends in Heaven or Earth: Thoſe that ſeem to flatter them, are not Friends but Foes; they rather wound them, and draw them into miſchief; whiles they lye in their blood there's no eye to pity them, to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48427:169"/> do any of theſe things for them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 5 No hand to help them, to waſh, ſalt, and ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5. If the Father of Bowels ſhut up his pity, Creatures can extend but little; whiles they reject the good <hi>Samaritane,</hi> none that paſſeth by regards them. <hi>If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do ſtoop under him, Job</hi> 9. 13. If God be angry, who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend us? O ſinner, If God frown, what is the love of Creatures? O thy caſe is doleful, thou thou art a poor Soul indeed, that art out of Chriſt; if he wound, none can heal, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 10. <hi>If he cut off, or ſhut up, or gather together, none can hinder him.</hi> Chriſtleſs Souls are like a Gangreen member, in danger of being cut off if a ſudden cure be not found: and who then can befriend them? where the Lord of hoſts is a Friend, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are Friends: And where he is an Enemy, Creatures are Enemies too: If God be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a Soul, the Creatures are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant too. And if God be againſt a Soul, all his armies fight againſt that Soul too: O ſinners, who can be friend you? ſuppoſe you have Rich kindred, great acquaintance, what can they do at the Bar of God for you? They will not go to the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt, and ſpeak for you there.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, A poor man is one that is lightly eſteemed: This <hi>David</hi> gives as a Teſtimony of a mean ſtate; when ſome were ſent to treat with him about a match with <hi>Saul</hi>'s daughter; he modeſtly puts it off. <hi>Who I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am a poor man, and lightly eſteemed,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 23. The word is contemptible, of little, little worth.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48427:170"/> Rich men are ſure of honour; but the poor are little regarded: Great perſons are Courted, when the poor are ſleighted, paſſed by, little eſteemed. So 'tis with Chriſtleſs Souls: They are lightly eſteemed: God hath a very low ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them: The ungodly in Gods account are like the Chaff the Wind drives away, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 1. 4. So are the wicked, let them be what they will, in greateſt dignity here below; they are glittering ſtars in the worlds Eye, but falling Comets in God's account: The mighty King of <hi>Babylon</hi> being a wicked man, God accounts him but an abominable Branch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 19. So Chriſt calls proud <hi>Herod,</hi> a Fox, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 32. God reckons them as broken Pitchers: Wicked <hi>Coniah</hi> is as a broken Veſſel in whom is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 28. No more doth God reckon of wicked men, though under all the grandure of the World: Angels do not regard them: They do not account them worth their company, and attendance: The Saints are guarded by Angels; but wicked men are let alone: Angels are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Spirits to the Heirs of Salvation; not to the Heirs of Hell; they have no charge at all, to watch over them; but to fight againſt them: They are ſet in battel array againſt them; good men cannot regard wicked men; let them be never ſo high and honourable: Though they give every man his due; yet they cannot weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuary as any thing: They had rather converſe with a poor Saint, than with the greateſt perſons in the world, if wicked, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 14. <hi>And</hi> Eliſha <hi>ſaid, As the Lord of hoſts liveth, before whom I</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:48427:170"/> 
                  <hi>ſtand; Surely were it not that I regarded the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of</hi> Jehoſhaphat <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>I would not look toward thee, nor ſee thee.</hi> So lightly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are wicked men in the Eyes of God, Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, A poor man is liable to dangers and ſufferings; he hath no might againſt the mighty, but lies open to the injuries and oppreſſions of thoſe that are above him, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Hear ye this word ye kine of</hi> Baſhan, <hi>which oppreſs the poor, which cruſh the needy:</hi> Poor men lye under the feet of the potent, and are ſubject to their Tiranny: <hi>On the oppreſſors ſide is power, and on the oppreſſeds ſide are tears, Eccl.</hi> 4. 1. So Chriſtleſs Souls are under the ruling power of Satan, and taken Captive by him at his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. They have no defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtroaks of Judgment; 'tis eaſie with God to cruſh them every moment; they no have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſecure themſelves from ruining vengeance, wicked men are no more match for God than Bryars and Thorns, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27 4. Yea they can no more reſiſt him than the ſtubble can the fire, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1. O ſinner, thou art a miſerable Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff indeed! O ſee thy poverty, let this ſtain thy glory; O ſinner, look about thee, whiles thou haſt a little time: Art thou willing to die ſo poor? O 'tis not Houſes, nor Lands, nor Money, nor Friends, can miniſter comfort to thee then; O how wilt thou do to live for ever, if thou haſt none of Chriſts tryed Gold.</p>
               <p>So much of the Third Inference.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein Chriſt is ſet forth to ſinners, as a Match wortby of their choice, in regard of the excellency of his Eſtate: The amiableneſs of his Perſon: His lovely Diſpoſitions and other Conſiderations to win the hearts of ſinners to be looking after this lovely Jeſus.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF there are ſuch vaſt treaſures in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; then this will follow hence: That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is worth the looking after by periſhing ſinners. O what a match is Jeſus Chriſt for undone ſinners; could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey but obtain him, how happy would they be for ever; this is a principal thing in a woers eye, to get a rich match; O Souls you cannot get a better match than Jeſus Chriſt, there's none like him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In point of Riches: O let me commend the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to you upon the account of his wealth: Sinners, if you would have a rich Husband; there's none ſo rich as Chriſt: He is wonderfully rich; if you but conſider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and number of his riches: If you obſerve the verity and variety of his treaſures: If you weigh the kind or degree of his ſubſtance, you will ſay he is exceeding rich: Take him poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or comparatively, he is vaſtly rich: he is really ſo, and ſuperlatively ſo: The worlds
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48427:171"/> treaſures are but ſhadows: But he hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; true ſolid ſubſiſting treaſures, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>That I may cauſe them that love me to inherit ſubſtance, and I will fill their treaſures.</hi> Chriſt's Gold is tryed Gold, that which can bear the hardeſt touch, and abide the fire: And he is ſuperlatively rich, none like him: <hi>Job</hi> was a rich man, but his riches were limitted within the Confines of a Countrey: He was the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, not in all the world, but of all the men of the Eaſt, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 3. But Chriſt is richeſt of all: All the Men and Angels in Heaven and Earth put together cannot vye treaſures with Chriſt: What was ſaid of the vertuous woman is true of Chriſt, he excels them all, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 29. O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, would you have a rich match, caſt your eyes on Jeſus Chriſt: He hath a very taking Eſtate, that will be wonderful attractive upon your hearts if rightly ſet. I ſhall ſhew in a few particulars what an Eſtate Chriſt hath.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a fair Eſtate, exceeding large and full; 'tis incomprehenſible, and paſt finding out, both as to his perſonal, and purchaſed Treaſure: It is in heighth, depth, length, breadth, paſſing knowledge, as hath been ſhewn at large, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18, 19. Chriſts Eſtate is as large as himſelf is, and he is paſt finding out: <hi>Who can ſearch out the Almighty to perfection? Job</hi> 11. 7. All mens Eſtates lie here in the lower world, within the meaſure of a ſpot of ground: But Chriſt's treaſure fills Heaven and Earth: The Heavens, yea the Heaven of Heavens are his, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 6. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is rich e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way conſidered: He is rich in inheritance:
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48427:172"/> 
                  <hi>Heir of all things, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. He is rich in Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, he hath abundance of choice Jewels; he hath a day on purpoſe to make up his Jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. He is rich in manſions too, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>In my Fathers Houſe are many manſions.</hi> A man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for every Heir of Glorie: O how many Houſes hath this Heir of all things? How many dwelling places in Glory? He is rich in Crowns and Thrones: We account that man rich that hath two or three Kingdoms: But Jeſus Chriſt hath a multitude of Crowns: A Crown for every Subject, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 28. Every ſaved Soul is a Crowned King, or ſhall be ſo to all Eternitie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. Every overcoming Soul ſhall ſit on Thrones; and every one wearing a Crown of Glorie, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. O what a vaſt Potentate is Jeſus Chriſt: All the Angels in Heaven cannot draw an inventory of Chriſts Eſtate, ſo number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs are his Treaſures: He that hath ſo many millions of Saints, and can give every one of them a Kingdom: O how rich muſt this Lord be? O ſinners think what a rich Jointure Chriſt can make you; he can ſettle an Eſtate upon you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. O will you Eſpouſe Chriſt, he hath a fair Eſtate indeed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath a free Eſtate: Some men may have large Eſtates, but many Mortgages and debts upon them; but Chriſt's Eſtate is all free; no debts lies on Chriſt to leſſen his Eſtate; whatever he gives to the whole Creation, doth no way leſſen his Riches; like the Sun, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver light it imparts to the World, or Inferiour Luminaries, doth not exhauſt or diminiſh it's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſplendour; all that the Rivers emptie from
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48427:172"/> the Sea, do not leſſen it, but repay its bounty by a retribution of all thoſe receptions; ſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever contributions come from Chriſt to men, it doth not leſſen his ability to give to his people: The more <hi>Abraham</hi> gave to his Sons by <hi>Keturah,</hi> the leſs he had for <hi>Iſaac:</hi> But Chriſt's liberality and Obligations do not diminiſh his treaſure; Chriſt's whole Eſtate comes to every Believer, every ſaved Soul hath a whole Chriſt full of Grace and Glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt hath a ſure Eſtate, exceeding ſafe; there's no defrauding of his Spouſe, no pre-mortgage to take it away: If Chriſt's Life could not be taken from him without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when he was Mediatour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18. Then all the Eſtate he hath purchaſed with his blood is unremoveable; the Father hath given it, who is greater than all, and in whoſe hands Believers are put, and their Eſtates ſecured for them: All new-Covenant promiſes are ſure, as you have heard, part of which is the inheritance of the Saints. This Eſtate is ſure both by dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purchaſe: The Father hath given Chriſt and all that is his to Believers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 4. <hi>I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to be a witneſs to the people, a leader and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to the people:</hi> This ſhews the certainty and truth of this Covenant which is confirmed in Chriſt, whom the Father hath given and made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Believers to be the confirmation of his promiſes. 'Tis confirm'd by purchaſe; he hath bought and paid for't; he went and ſold all to get this pearl; he parted with his Life, Blood, Glory, his All, to get this Eſtate for Believers:
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48427:173"/> The Father hath received every Farthing of the money, and gives him an acquittance under his hand, declares before men and Angels, that Chriſt ows him nothing for all the whole Eſtate he hath purchas'd for Believers, <hi>Mat</hi> 3. 17. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> O 'tis a ſure Eſtate. A conveyance is made of it to Chriſt in the behalf of Believers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 8. <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 18. All power is put into the hands of Chriſt: The Deeds are drawn, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably ſealed between the Father and the Son, that the Eſtate is firm and ſure to all Believers: Nay the ſeiſure and delivery is given, and Chriſt hath taken poſſeſſion of it, and he is entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heavens in the behalf of Believers, and all to make this ſure. O ſinners will you eſpouſe Hell, and let go Jeſus Chriſt, who is Heir of Life, and Glory, that hath ſuch a ſure Eſtate for you?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He hath a ſutable Eſtate: Let a man have a fair, free, and ſure Eſtate, yet if it be not ſutable to his quality, neceſſities, and deſires, 'tis unſatisfying: But Chriſt's Eſtate is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way ſutable both to himſelf, and to his Bride: He hath a large inheritance ſutable for his dignity, and to his Spouſes quality: Chriſt having finiſhed his work on Earth, being about to drink the laſt draught of the Cup; he comes and treats with the Father about his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and 'tis Glory ſutable to his quality: <hi>O Father glorifie thou me with thy ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was, Joh.</hi> 17. 1. to <hi>ver.</hi> 5. O unreaſonable Souls, that deſpiſe Chriſt; O ſinners! had you ever ſuch a Lover ſtood at your doors? No, nor never will
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48427:173"/> have the like, if you refuſe this Jeſus: Yea, 'tis a ſutable Eſtate to his Spouſe too: 'Tis a fit joynture for the Kings Daughter, ſufficient to maintain her Immortality, and Glory, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 29. <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom:</hi> Now a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is a ſutable ſtate to a Kings Daughter: O Souls! will you fall in Love with Chriſt? he hath Crowns, Thrones, a Kingdom of Glory for you.</p>
               <p>Then 'tis an Eſtate ſutable to your neceſſities too: There's enough in Chriſt to ſpend upon, and maintain you bravely, richly, here and for ever: O ſinners, will you match with Chriſt? whatever you need is in him. <hi>My God ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all you wants, Phil.</hi> 4. 19. If a Kingdom will do it, you ſhall not want it: If a Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will make you happy and bleſſed you ſhall not want it; his Eſtate is fullneſs that filleth all in all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23. O Believer, it may be thou want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bread, Cloaths, Money, and thou goeſt up and down dejected, ſad, full of fears: But haſt thou eſpouſed Chriſt? O conſider thou haſt a fullneſs, O what a vaſt Eſtate hath Jeſus Chriſt for thee. Sinners, your wants are many, more then you know, God only knows your wants, Sinners, yet there's enough in Chriſt's Eſtate and Patrimony to ſupply them all.</p>
               <p>Then 'tis ſutable alſo to their deſires. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners deſires are large; O what wandring things are the deſires; perſons may deſire things to the utmoſt ends of the Earth, which they cannot get: But all that the Believer rationally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, Chriſt's Eſtate can ſatisfie: <hi>He will fulfill the deſires of them that fear him, Pſa.</hi> 145. 19. Yea, 'tis above their deſires: Deſire as much as
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48427:174"/> thou canſt, Chriſt's Eſtate is above thy deſires, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 15. O what a treaſure then is Chriſt! it fills every chink of the Believers deſires, with an overplus: 'Tis more than can be deſired.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, 'Tis a pleaſant Eſtate, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>The lines are fallen to me in a pleaſant place, yea, I have a goodly herritage.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee</hi> renders it in ſweetneſs, others delightful place: A great Eſtate if it be not well ſcituated, and lye not in a pleaſant place, is not half ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentful; but Chriſts Eſtate is well ſcituated; it hath all conſiderations and circumſtances that may make it deſirable. <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was a type of it, is call'd the pleaſant Land, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 19. 'Tis in the Original, the land of deſires: So the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers portion that is prepared for him by Chriſt; 'tis a Land of deſires; an Inheritance of beauty and Glory: Chriſts Riches are very precious and pleaſant Riches, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>And by knowledge ſhall the Chambers be filled with all precious and pleaſant Riches.</hi> Rare, as the word imports; delighting Riches: The whole poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of Chriſt are pleaſant, the way to it is pleaſant, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 17. The borders of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt are made with pleaſant ſtones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 12. <hi>And all thy borders of pleaſant ſtones.</hi> The firſt fruits of Chriſt's harveſt is all pleaſure and delight, much more the lump; the maintenance he allows his Children here in the way is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much more the Eſtate reſerved at the Journeys end. The Fruits that fall from this Tree of Life is ſweet to thoſe that ſit under its ſhaddow, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. how much more to them
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48427:174"/> that climb, and crop the pleaſant fruits thereof. <hi>Their drink is pleaſant,</hi> Pſal. 36. 8. <hi>Thou ſhalt make them drink of the Rivers of thy pleaſures.</hi> And at laſt he brings them to his Right Hand, where are pleaſures for evermore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is a peaceful ſtate, not liable to conteſts and controverſies, as mens Eſtates oft-times are here: A man may have a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but it may be a litigious Eſtate: It may occaſion many Law Suits about it: But it is not ſo in Chriſt's Eſtate: 'Tis a peaceful Eſtate; no wars grow out of this Eſtate: Chriſts Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is called <hi>Salem:</hi> The Land of peace, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 76. 2. And he is <hi>The King of Salem;</hi> The King of peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>His Kingdom is Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14. 17. He is their peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14. In him they ſhall have peace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. His very Doctrine are words of peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 17. He came to guide our feet into the way of peace, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 79. <hi>He came and Preached Peace:</hi> O what a bleſſed Eſtate hath Chriſt; what a lovely Lord is Chriſt: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queaths peace to his people: Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 27. They have peace with God who Eſpouſe this Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. Peace with Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. Peace with Conſcience too, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22 The Fruits of the Spirit is Peace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. His Riches have no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row annexed with them.</p>
               <p>7thly, It is a perpetual Eſtate: <hi>An inheritance that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Chriſts Riches are durable Riches, aged Riches, ſtrong, ſolid, Riches: <hi>Opes denſae,</hi> that is <hi>

'Tis ſaid of the <hi>Cedar,</hi> worms will not breed in it; ſure there's no worm in Chriſt's Treaſure: O Souls, 'tis a laſting Eſtate: That neither time nor changes can waſt nor weaken: All the Saints ſpending upon it to all Eternity, never detracts from it: Chriſts Treaſures are like the deep waters, or like the bottomleſs Ocean, that cannot be exhauſted; his treaſure will laſt as long as God, the Soul, and Eternity laſts, which is for ever, for ever, for ever. Some men have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd their Leaſes and their Eſtates and have ſeen an end of their Houſes and Riches; but the Spouſe of Chriſt can never out-live her jointure, it laſts to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, 'Tis a poſſeſt eſtate: Some may have great eſtates, but it is in reverſion, they may look long for it, as ſome Heirs do all their days: But Chriſts Eſtate is all in his own hand, 'tis actually made over to him by the Father, and poſſeſſion given him when he ſate down at the Right hand of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1 3. He hath actually obtained this Inheritance with the Fruits of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4. And is actually inveſted with this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 7. This ſinners is the Eſtate of that Beloved that is tendered to you in the Goſpel for your choice; he is very wealthy, he hath a fair, free, ſure, ſutable, pleaſant, peaceful, perpetual poſſeſſion; an Eſtate you cannot ſpend or comprehend; an Inheritance you cannot loſe or out-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, Doſt thou diſlike his perſon?

How the Spouſe diſplays him, and you will find him a beautiful Perſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to the end, <hi>His head is as the moſt fine gold:</hi> His Wiſdom and Government is moſt pure, ſolid and excellent: <hi>His locks are buſhy and black as a Raven:</hi> Which notes not only his love lineſs, but his ſtrength and vigour he hath his radical moyſture, his vital heat: He is ſtrong, his vigour abides with him; he hath ſtrength ſufficient for all his undertakings, and he is able to go through what he ſets his hand unto; he is ſtrong, vigorous, and ſpritely. <hi>His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the Rivers of Waters, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Milk, and fitly ſet.</hi> His ſight is quick, and perfect, his underſtanding is infinite: His Counſels are holy, and conſiſtent, all well ſet, his decrees, his purpoſes, all methodically ordered and fixed: His looks are gracious, his aſpects lovely, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring the eyes of them that behold him. O ſuch a lovely Chriſt is tendred to Sinners; O I know not how to ſet him forth to your capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he is a moſt taking object indeed. <hi>His face is white and ruddy:</hi> Emblems of Rich Beauty, captivating the eyes, and raviſhing the hearts of beholders: The purity of the divine nature, with the paſſions of the humane, and procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Redemption, ſets him forth as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely amiable in the eyes of Believers. <hi>His cheeks are as a bed of ſpices, as ſweet flowers:</hi> His

O how rich are his affections, what a Treaſure to thoſe that have him. <hi>His legs are as Pillars of Marble, ſet upon ſockets of fine gold.</hi> The gracious motions
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48427:177"/> and efficacious workings of his Spirit, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mighty and glorious; full of ſtrength: He hath power to bear up all thoſe that follow him: His legs are ſtrong, he can carry his Lambs that are committed to his arms; there's no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den too heavy for Chriſt, his loins are ſtrong, he can bear what is laid upon him; the weight of all the Saints on Earth is nothing to him: He can carry on all his intendments and intereſt in the World; his legs are as Marble, able to bear his Body; quick in motion: O what a lovely Chriſt is this diſplay'd in the Goſpel! <hi>His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is as</hi> Labanon, <hi>excellent as the Cedars:</hi> Thoſe diſcoveries the Lord Jeſus Chriſt makes of himſelf in his word, and works, are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful taking; exceeding enriching: Chriſt's word is fruit fullizing: O when he ſpeaks to the hearts of his Children, what a deal of vertue goes through his lips; Grace is poured out of his lips, Milk and hony is under his tongue: His appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances carries excellency, riches and glory with them, <hi>His mouth is moſt ſweet, yea he is altogether lovely:</hi> His diſcourſes, the openings of his mind is wonderful pleaſing: The word of Chriſt never cloys the ſpiritual part. Thus you ſee what a Perſon Jeſus Chriſt is: O Sinners conſider his beauty; O how lovely an object is he! what can you object againſt his Perſon, why you will not eſpouſe him?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider his lovely diſpoſitions, O Sinners will you accept of him? He is of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit, of a very ſweet nature; full of grace and goodneſs: His ſweet diſpoſitions have been largely opened already, he is full of mercy and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48427:177"/> compaſſions, meekneſs, gentleneſs, patience, long-ſuffering, ſlow to anger, ready to forgive, great in kindneſs, free and bountiful, of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirit; true and faithful: Sinners, you may truſt him with your ſecrets; you may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your Souls upon him: He is harmleſs, and inoffenſive; he doth wrong to no man; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is lovely and deſirable: His converſes are pleaſant and profitable: O what a perſon is Chriſt! O Sinners, never was ſuch a one offer'd you as Chriſt is; why will you not come unto him?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider his quality and high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he is no mean Perſon, but a mighty Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. The ſole and only ſuperintendent of the whole World, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>He hath on his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and on his thigh a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords:</hi> He is not only a King, but <hi>the</hi> King, the only true Potentate from whom all ohters derive their glory, a King not only of Men, but of Saints; not only of Saints, but of Angels, of Thrones, Principalities and Powers: <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 53. And can command them down now he is in Heaven for the ſervice of his elect, <hi>Heb</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Are they not all Miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to Miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> O Sinners! ſhall this prevail with you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take notice of his potency: He hath power as well as honour, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 18. All things are put under his feet, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. All the Armies of Heaven and Earth are deliver'd over to him: He is Lord of Hoſts: He hath
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48427:178"/> the Keys of Heaven, Death and Hell: <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. Who then can lock out Chriſt, or exclude him from doing what he pleaſeth, ſeeing all things are at his beck? <hi>He doth whatſoever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him in Heaven and in Earth, in the Seas and in all deep places, Pſa.</hi> 135. 6. He ſitteth in the Heavens, and laughs the Counſels of the Potentates to ſcorn; he makes no reckoning of their combinations, but derides their ambitious attempts againſt him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2. 4. He ſhall paſs thorow and over-flow, and break all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſederacies in pieces, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 8, 9, 10. Let all the ſubtleties of Hell be woven together, to make a web to catch the intereſt of Chriſt in; it ſhall all be as a ſpiders web, that can ſoon be ſwept away. O admire the Kingdom of Chriſt; the glorious power of Chriſt; nothing is too hard for him: He hath an abſolute, unlimited and uncontroulable power: He is the ſupream over all perſons, and all things, in all places, Lands, and Countries: O what power hath he! not only <hi>Authority,</hi> but likewiſe <hi>Might,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>In his hand there is power and might, and none is able to withſtand him:</hi> O Sinners come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Chriſt, he can protect you and defend you from dangers.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Obſerve his wiſdom too: this is taking with ſome to have a head that hath intellectuals in him, and marry one that hath exquiſite parts and eminency of knowledge. Now all Treaſures of wiſdom are in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. His judgments are unſearchable and paſt finding out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>His judgments,</hi> his acts in the World, his Righteous deeds, and the way he takes to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48427:178"/> accompliſh his deſigns; O how wonderful deep are they! <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him; the Spirit of wiſdom, and underſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and might; the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 11. 2. He is of quick underſtanding, full of judgment; called <hi>The wonderful Counſellour, Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. The only wiſe God, from whom all wiſdom is fetch'd, that fills Men and Angels; all the World do light their Candles at his Torch: He is the Sun that fills the whole Creation with beams: There's no ſearching of his underſtanding; he can bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. He hath eyes can reach where men cannot; he can reveal the deep things of God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. O Sinners, what an excellent one is Chriſt! O how worthy of your choice!</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Weigh the glorious and bleſſed effects of your cloſing with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Sinners, the very day you marry Chriſt he will pay all your debts, and they are many; he will pardon all your ſins, blot out all your iniquities, remember them no more: He will free you from all your Bondages, deliver you from all your fears, ſecure you from all your dangers; if you will but eſpouſe him. O the very day you marry Chriſt he will wipe off all your ſhame, and remove your reproach: He will heal all your wounds and ſickneſſes, he will begin to heal them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and never leave till he hath perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured your Souls: He will ſtrip off all your filthy garments, and cloath you with broidered rayment; he will advance you to higheſt dignity; he will lift up your heads above your fellows:
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48427:179"/> He will make you Kings and Prieſts to God; he will ſet you in Heavenly places; he will ſeal your title to a Rich Joynture, he will make ſure your intereſt to all the Treaſures of Heaven: He will poſſeſſe you with grace, and aſſure you of glory: O ſinners, is not this argument e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to win your Souls, and make you willing to accept of ſuch a Majeſty as Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Sinners think upon the greatneſs of that love t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Lord Jeſus Chriſt bears you: He hath good-will towards Men, towards ſinners, as ſinners, whiles in their blood, he hath a love of pity for you: 'Tis true till you cloſe with Chriſt he can have no love of acquieſcenſe in you; but he hath a love of good-will to your Souls, he hath ſo much love for you, as hath made him willing to ſhed his blood for you; his love brought him down from the Fathers Glory, made him willing to drink the dregs of a cup of wrath for you; the love of Chriſt to Sinners, hath ſet up a ſtanding Miniſtery in the World, ſent forth multitudes to publiſh glad tidings: O Sinners, did you but believe this, how attractive would it be upon your hearts, to draw you to Chriſt. But if none of theſe arguments will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, let me adde one conſideration more.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The effects of your refuſing Jeſus Chriſt will be dreadful: if you will not accept of this propoſal; O think what a terrible anſwer Chriſt will ſend you: Such ſhall not taſte of his Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 24. Not a crumb that fall from this Rich Table of Salvation-chear ſhall fall to the ſhare of that wretched ſinner. If you will not have his Perſon you ſhall not have his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe:
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48427:179"/> He hath ſworn in his wrath theſe ſhall never enter into his Reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 11. O ſinner! were there no other Hell but the loſs of Heaven, it were enough to break thy heart in pieces: O think upon the ſad Iſſue of thy final unbelief: When thy ſins get over thy head, and thy guilt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows thee at thy heels; When Death and Hell ſhall be at thy back, and then to call and cry, and knock at the door of mercy and not be heard; O what a doleful thing will this be! When ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of devils are round about thee, ready to ſnatch thy Soul into everlaſting burnings, and none to relieve thee; O fearful will the caſe of thy Soul be! When thou ſhalt cry; O for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſake, Help Lord; I am going to Hell, for mercies ſake help; and then for the Ear of God to be deaf, and thou not have one good word, and the door be ſhut againſt thee; O what a dolefull caſe will this be! for tender mercy to ceaſe; is miſerable: But for mercy to become cruel to you; O fearful caſe indeed! when ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Bowels ſhall become Braſs and Iron, and there ſhall be no ſounding at all in it towards thy Soul: O ſinner if thou wilt not accept of this Chriſt, he will laugh at thy Calamity, and mock when thy Fear cometh, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 26. That's terrible; when God ſhall not only ceaſe to pity, but deride thy miſery: Be aſſur'd, Soul, as quiet as now thou art, a day of Calamity will come; there will come a time of Fears for thy poor Soul, and then will mercy it ſelf be turn'd into wrath, and laugh at thy Calamity; yet further (ſinner) if thou wilt not accept of Chriſt; then will incenſed fury ſend forth its army of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ruine, and cut off thy Soul for ever, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:48427:180"/> 22. 7. Then ſhalt thou be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of God, and from the glory of his Power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8, 9. Then ſhall vengeance glut it ſelf upon thy Soul, and ſeize upon thee in flaming Fire: O 'tis a dreadful thing to lye at the mercy of vengeance: O what will not enraged fury do to its adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, when it hath them at its power? But what will divine vengeance do? O ſinner, when God ſhall arraign thee at the Bar of Judgment for kicking at the Bowels of mercy; for Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head of Chriſt with thorns, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his blood under feet; what wilt thou do then? (O canſt thou read this and not ſhake) when thou ſhalt ſee Devils round about thee, and flaming vengeance take hold of thee: But thus it will be. Then they that would not let Chriſt reign over them; ſhall feel Devils rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: Then they that fled from the Arms of mercy, ſhall fall into the Jaws of fury: Then they that ſhut their ears againſt the fervent woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt ſhall open their hearts to the fiery wrath of Chriſt: Then they that would not get into the boſom of Chriſt; ſhall lodge in the burnings of Hell: Then the Furnace of Hell ſhall be heated ſeven times hotter for thoſe whoſe hearts freezed under the warm beams of Chriſt's Love: Oh dreadful will thy ſtate be, Sinner, if thou refuſe Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Well ſinner, take the Counſel given thee: kiſs the Son Ieſt he be angry; turn in, turn in hither; reach out thy arms, come away to Chriſt; ſay Lord Jeſus, I am willingly thine. Sinners are you perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? what anſwer ſhall we return to this Lord of Glory? Will you be his? Will you accept
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48427:180"/> of this grace tendered to you, before it breathe its laſt to you.</p>

               <p>1. Objection. Says a Soul: <hi>But will this bleſſed Potentate, this glorious King of Kings, ſtoop ſo low as to look upon ſuch an obſcure Creature, ſuch a worthleſs worm as I am? Alas! I am too mean to unlooſe the latchet of his ſhooes: I am too unworthy to be the meaneſt Servant in his Houſe: To be a dog to his Flock: And will he caſt his skirt over me?

When he left his Fathers Kingdom, and came down from his Eternal Glory with the Father, he gave abundant proof of the humility of his heart: when he did eſpouſe thy nature,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48427:181"/> (ſinner) to himſelf; and took upon him the form of a Servant; he ſhewed his humble heart, that he was far from contemning ſinners: He was the true <hi>Jacob,</hi> who ſerved a far harder bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage for thy Soul, than ever <hi>Jacob</hi> did for his <hi>Rach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And his humility hath been abundantly prov'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: He will dwell with the Lowly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15.</p>
               <p>2.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſts deſign in theſe Goſpel tenders of himſelf to ſinners, is not to get, but to give Riches: He wants no treaſures for himſelf, but he rather wants objects to give them to: He wants no goods, but (like the Rich man in the

               <p>6. Object. But ſaies the Soul: <hi>I have ſleighted many calls already: I have quenched many moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit: I have deſpiſed the firſt call: and may I have hopes to go to Chriſt? Will he receive me?</hi>

               <p>7. Object. <hi>But I am never the better for all the means and mercy I have enjoyed: though I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the firſt calls of mercy, yet if I had been the better for after tenders of grace, there were ſome hope: But I am ſtill the ſame notwithſtanding all the Sermons I hear, and precious overtures of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; my heart is hard, and dead under all.</hi>
               </p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So it was with the Impotent man a great while, he was diſeaſed thirty and eight years. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 5. He lay at the Pool's ſide near the means of cure, but never the better, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 7. And ſo continued till Chriſts time came to cure him. So Iſrael were barren and unfruitful, till the Lord became a dew to them. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. Therefore this is no diſcouragement; if thou believe and come to Chriſt, God will be a dew to thee, and thou ſhalt quickly find a change.</p>
               <p>8. Object. But ſaith one: <hi>I am not only never the better for all the means of grace, but I am worſe than I was before; when I was under firſt awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, my heart was more tender; but now my heart ſeems to be more brawny and hard; I find more unbelief than ever, more indiſpoſition to go to Chriſt: I am worſe than I was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So was <hi>Sarah</hi> too, as to the receiving the promiſed mercy, more and more indiſpoſed, ſhe complaines of the deadneſs of her womb; ſhe was paſt age to be the Mother of Children, till the time of life came, then <hi>Sarah's</hi> growing indiſpoſition becomes no impediment at all to the fulfilling of the promiſe. So was <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they began to ſay for their part, their hope was cut off, and God had forſaken them, when mercy was neareſt to them: So the woman that had a bloody iſſue twelve years, and had ſpent all that ſhe had on Phyſitians, yet was nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but rather grew worſe, till Chriſt came and healed her, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 25, 26. Perſons are uſually worſt in their own eyes when mercy is neareſt their doors.</p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:48427:184"/>
               <p> Again, Thy not comming to Chriſt is the cauſe of thy decaies and hardnings; 'tis thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief that deadens thy heart, and withers thy Soul, Chriſt doth withdraw his influence from ſuch, and refuſeth to do any mighty works in them becauſe of unbelief. O then Soul, come away to Chriſt, and this is the way to cure thee.</p>
               <p>9. Object. But ſaies the Soul: <hi>Chriſt ſeems to take no notice of me, I call but he heareth me not, I come to Ordinances, but I cannot ſee him, nay he ſeems to be angry with me; every thing goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, his word ſpeaks bitter things to me; methinks there's never a threatning but belongs to me; I am the Hypocrite and unclean perſon, that God ſtrikes at in every Sermon, and his rod lies heavy on me too, and in the way of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he writes bitter things againſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Soul, is this thy caſe, doth Chriſt take no notice of thee? It is becauſe thou takeſt ſo little of him, when he unveils his beauty; thou doſt not believe in him, when he makes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to thy Soul: When he ſends words of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, thou doſt not obey him. He hath called, and thou haſt not anſwered, and therefore when thou calleſt he doth not anſwer, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 13. Yet at ſuch a time what follows; doth God make an end of ſuch ſinners? No, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 2, 3. O Soul, if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſeems to take no notice of thee, but to frown upon thee, it is to frown thee from thy unbelief; it is but to make thee ſenſible of thy ſlighting him: If thou wilt this day accept of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; his
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48427:184"/> frowns will ſoon paſs away, as a dark Cloud doth when the Sun ſhines; he will remember thy Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities no more.</p>
               <p>10. Object. But may ſome Soul ſay: <hi>I would fain come to Chriſt, but I cannot; I like the terms well, but O my unbelieving heart! O my impenitent hard heart! I cannot ſenſe Salvation-kindneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> O Soul! The afflicting ſenſe of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, is a hopeful ſign of thy faith: If thou doſt ſee thy unbelieving heart; ſo as to be burdened under it, and be weary of it, the Lord reckons it for the beginnings of faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. This is the method of Salvation-Grace in begetting faith, to convince thee of its impotency to believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 9. Soul, is this thy wearineſs; that thou canſt not come to Chriſt? Wouldſt thou have a wider heart for him? Thou art the Soul he waits for that mourneſt over thy unbelief, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>But there's one thing more may be as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſome Souls.</p>
               <p>11. Object. <hi>O ſaies the Soul, I fear the time is paſt, and that God will be gracious no more; I have had a day of grace, but that is gone: The Angel came troubling the Waters, but I would not ſtep in: I bave had the dawnings of mercy, but I reſiſted: I fear I have outſtood my Market: That I have outſtrived the Spirit ſo long, that he will ſtrive no more: And this bows me down, that I am afraid to look up.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:48427:185"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sinner, if this be thy caſe, know that thy fears of loſing the day of grace, is a ſign it is not loſt: The greateſt ſymptome of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace is ſecurity, and falſe peace, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 3. So it was with the people before the flood: <hi>Noah</hi> threatned judgments, but they dreamt of peace, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 37. &amp;c. Security uſher'd in the departure of grace from them: But while the Spirit of grace ſtrives with thy Soul, the day of grace is not paſt from thee. Doth God call upon thee now, and plead with thy heart? And doſt thou find ſome movings, and turnings of thy Bowels in thee, crying out, O that there might be mercy for me; that this day of grace may not be paſt? If ſo, then ſure the Spirit ſtrives yet with thy Soul: Therefore, Soul, if now thou wilt cloſe with Chriſt, none of theſe pleas can debar thy cloſing with him.</p>
               <p>Well Sinners, conſider the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites you to come to him, once more he demands your anſwer: what ſay you, will you be his or no? Do your hearts accept of him? Do you like his propoſals? will you heartily conſent to be his, upon all his terms? If ſo, I ſhall lay down ſome Counſels to direct you in your right comming to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sinner, if thou will come to Chriſt, thou muſt come as a poor needy, empty, undone, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſtript of all beauty, as having nothing at all that may deſerve his favour: <hi>'Tis the poor have the Goſpel Preached to them. Math.</hi> 11. 5. It ſignifies ſuch as are brought to great neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and extremities; So <hi>Beza</hi> renders it: <hi>Such as are brought very low:</hi> Therefore ſome derive it from a word that ſignifies, <hi>falling down at the</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:48427:185"/> 
                  <hi>rich Mens feet:</hi> As ſome beggers will. <hi>Ferus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it, the poor in Spirit, that acknowledge themſelves mean, and are low in their own eyes. So <hi>Calvin</hi> takes it, for them that are oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſenſe of their own wants, ſuch as feel their pinching neceſſities; that lye down overwhelm'd with the apprehenſion of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs: The Treaſures of the Goſpel are deſign'd to ſuch Perſons that are poor and afflicted in their own Spirits. There's no greater obſtacle in this Match betwen Chriſt and ſinners, than a ſenſe of ſelf worthyneſs: This keeps many from ſeeing the beauty of Chriſt; their own Righteouſneſs hangs in their eye; they are too heavy laden with their own thick clay, I mean the ſenſe of their own worthyneſs, to be looking up to Jeſus, and lifted up to him: Sinners may be too rich for Chriſt in their own opinion, but never too poor; hence the Lord Jeſus Chriſt tells us, he came not to call the Righteous, but ſinners to Repentance, <hi>Math.</hi> 9. 13. Not them that Judge themſelves Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but them that feel themſelves ſinners: The Rich he ſends empty away, thoſe that are Rich in their own thoughts, when the poor and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry are fill'd with good things: Men chuſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty veſſels to put their liquors in; and low rooms to cellar their wines, ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt chuſe empty Souls for his good things: He chooſeth the Low plains for his walks, when the high towring Mountains are rejected: The high, and lofty One comes to dwell in the low and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. Sinner, thou muſt ſtrip thy ſelf of thy own Ornaments, if thou
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48427:186"/> intend to put on Jeſus Chriſt: Thou muſt throw down thy Crown at his feet; if thou thinkeſt to wear his Crown on thy head: O Soul! thou muſt come as a poor wretch to Chriſt; with thy empty ſack, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons did to <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy corn, and then thou ſhalt have Treaſure too: Thou muſt ſee thy ſelf an undone ſinner; thou muſt come (with <hi>Lazarus)</hi> and throw thy ſelf down at this Rich Kings Door; if ever thou wilt be fed with his Crumbs; nay rather feaſted with his Dainties.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thou muſt come to Chriſt as to a full and ſufficient treaſure, able to ſave and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thee; to pay off thy debts, and enrich thy Soul for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. Able to ſupply all thy wants and fill all thy emptineſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. We have ſhewn already that his treaſures are bottomleſs, boundleſs, unfathomable, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible, never to be waſted or ſpent: O Soul come to Chriſt as ſuch a one: Meaſure not Chriſt's gold by thy buſhel; nor his plenty by thy poverty: think not thy debts too great for Chriſt to pay, becauſe thou knoweſt not where to get mony of thy own: Think not thy ſtraits too many for him to relieve: He hath enough for thy Soul to live upon both here and to all Eternity; O Sinner believe this, and come to him as ſuch a one; ſuppoſe not the Fountain is empty, becauſe thy Ciſterns are dry: <hi>His Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is like the great Mountains, Pſa.</hi> 36. 6. It is in the Hebrew, <hi>The Mountains of God:</hi> And his grace is without meaſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt look to him as having a ſufficient fulneſs for thy Soul.</p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:48427:186"/>
               <p> Thirdly, Thou muſt look to Chriſt with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, as the poor Cripple did to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, Acts.</hi> 3. 5. Now ſhall a poor Creature expect to receive ſome needful ſutable good from a fellow Creature; and will not thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome mercy from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thy Creator, and Redeemer? O ſinner come with expectations to Chriſt; believe that he is as willing as able to enrich all that come to him: He hath paſt his word for it. <hi>He that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out. Joh.</hi> 6. 37. He that believeth on him ſhall not periſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. The weary Soul that comes yea creeps to him, ſhall have reſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 28. The thirſty Soul ſhall be ſatisfied, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37. He goes up and down in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, ſeeking to ſave that which is loſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10. And he is angry with them that will not come to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. O ſinner, do not take up hard thoughts of Chriſt: Such ſuſpitious thoughts of Chriſt is ſome of the Devils ſeed that he doth ſow in broken ground. When Chriſt comes to break ſinners hearts and make them ſenſible of their undoneneſs, then the Devil caſts in theſe tares, and raiſes up ill thoughts of Chriſt; It was this did ſo enervate the diligence of the unprofitable Servant; ſome undue thoughts he took up of his Lords bounty: <hi>I knew</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>thou wert an hard, and auſtere Man:</hi> Hence he puts up his Talent in a Napkin, and his hand in his boſom, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 24, 25. Jealouſies of Chriſts good-will to ſinners are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſtructive to Salvation-work: The Devil hath hindred many a Soul from coming to Chriſt, by caſting this block in his way. O then come with expectations; at leaſt come to Chriſt, with
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48427:187"/> as great hopes as the <hi>Lepers</hi> came to the Tents of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> who were Enemies; come to Chriſt the friend of Sinners. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 4. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured with ſome hopes; we may live, and we can but dye; they may kill us, and they may ſave us alive: But thy caſe is not ſo, if thou come and adventure on Chriſt, thou mayeſt be ſure, he will not kill thee: O look to Jeſus then with ſome hopes; ſay, who can tell but my Soul may live.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Cloſe firſt with Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and afterwards with his Treaſure: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs uſually ſomething from Chriſt draws the Sinner's firſt reſpects to him: The ſavor of his oyntments, ſome love-tokens, kindneſſes, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of neceſſity; ſenſe of undoneneſs may conduce to get the firſt glances of Sinners to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt; But though theſe allure to Chriſt, yet the firſt thing the Eſpouſed Soul muſt eye in his Match with Chriſt, is Chriſt himſelf; though theſe things draw the Soul, yet they do not center the Affections: Chriſt's kindneſſes are deſign'd as motives to beget an eſteem of himſelf in ſinners hearts: The knowledge of what Jeſus Chriſt hath for ſinners, an intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pardon, peace and Salvation for all that come to him, may be the Prodromus or fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts Perſon to ſinners view; but when they come to ſee him, they muſt firſt pitch upon himſelf; and till they come to this they cannot have a due and orderly cloſe with Chriſt: In all right and regular Matches, the Perſon muſt be firſt regarded, then the Portion: A Soul is not fit to match with Chriſt, till he comes
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48427:187"/> to ſee infinitely more worth in him, then in all his gifts, and favours: It was the excellency of Chriſt himſelf that drew <hi>Pauls</hi> higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to him, with reſpect to relation; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus my Lord: Paul</hi> ſets that fore-moſt; And then to be made conformable to his Death, and Reſurrection. The Spouſe was more taken with Chriſt's Perſon then with his Gifts: <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2, 3. Firſt himſelf was lovely, then his fruits. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>David</hi> counts nothing in Heaven, or Earth like to God in Chriſt. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73. 25. 'Tis ſordid love, and too unworthy of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal State, that values the Portion more then the Perſon; that Soul is too unworthy of Chriſt, who values any thing more then him: <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 37 It muſt be Chriſt himſelf, muſt ſit in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt ſeat in thy Soul. 'Tis a ſaying of <hi>Calvin, Tis an unworthy thing not to perfer one Chriſt above all:</hi> Thoſe Matches never prove comfortable where the Eſtate is eyed more then the Perſon, hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal love is broken, when the eſtate is gone; but where true conjugal love is, it is ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Perſon: Love that is ſet upon ſome Gifts of Chriſt, more then Chriſt himſelf, when theſe are ſuſpended, the others will decay; but love placed upon his Perſon will laſt: Hence 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do ſo eaſily leave Chriſt, when it comes to parting with other things, becauſe their love was ſet more upon theſe things then Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: O Soul be ſure 'tis Chriſt himſelf thou doſt chuſe, and not another; O be not guilty of that miſtake as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, to take <hi>Leah</hi> inſtead of <hi>Rachel:</hi> Be ſure it be not a falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of

If Chriſt muſt take the beſt place in Heaven, he hath reaſon to take the firſt place in thy heart.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If thou wouldeſt come to Chriſt aright, then bring thy all with thee to him; and make a free and full ſurrender of thy ſelf, and thy all to him: When God would have <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they muſt not leave a hoof behind, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>They firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord:</hi> Be ſure make over thy ſelf firſt to Chriſt, and then all thy intereſts, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities: Come and ſubſcribe to Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 5. <hi>One ſhall ſay I am the Lords, and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and another ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe with his hand unto the Lord.

O Soul try, can thy heart conſent to this? O the falſeneſs of Souls pretended match to Chriſt hath undone many! You muſt take whole Chriſt with the whole heart, or elſe you will never match aright with Chriſt, You muſt chuſe him never to chuſe again. You muſt make him your only choice, and let all your other chooſings be by him: <hi>Thou ſhalt chooſe our inheritance for us, Pſa.</hi> 47. 4. Say then, I will only chuſe him; I will chuſe his Perſon, his Laws, his Honour and Glory; but Chriſt ſhall chuſe all for me; Let Chriſt chuſe my place, and condition, high or low: Let Chriſt diſpoſe of me, where, and how he will in the World, I will diſpoſe of Chriſt in my heart.</p>

                  </gap>ppears they are vain, and will not profit in the day of wrath. Like a broken Staff, when you lean upon it, then it breaks: So the Riches of this world, when Souls put ſome ſtreſs upon them, then they fail: They are uncertain; ſometimes you enjoy them, and anon they are removed, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine Eyes upon that which is not, for riches certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make themſelves wings, they flye away as an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle towards Heaven.</hi> They come ſlowlie, but get off ſwiftlie; when they come to men, they have leaden feet, and when they leave them, Eagles Wings: To day they flouriſh like the graſs, and to morrow burn like an Oven: A man hath a beautiful houſe to day, and to morrow an heap of Aſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O moſt uncertain Riches!

One calls the whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire but a bone that is thrown to dogs: very dry meat; ſo are all the things of this world: Riches are like meat in a dream: An hungry man thinks he feeds, when he dreams but when he awakes he is emptie. Riches feed nothing but the Eye; hence Covetousneſs is call'd the luſts of the Eye, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16.

               <p>Thirdly, They are fading things in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: not only uncertain, and liable to remove in the event, but they are dying in their Nature; Corruptible riches: Your Houſes, Lands, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your greedy Eye covets, are but rotten things: Your Garments are liable to the Moth, and your Gold and Silver Subject to Ruſt, <hi>J am.</hi> 5. 2, 3.

               <p>Fourthly, The treaſures of this world are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaving treaſures; they bring their owners into bondage: as one ſays; <hi>Ducendo vincimur, vincendo ducimur: By their cunning allurements they overcome us, and overcoming us, they lead us Captive:</hi> They firſt allure the heart, and then enthrall the heart: They bring men into the worſt bondage of any, for they bring them into a willing bondage Earthly men are not only led Captive by the world at Satans will, but are enſlaved by their own will; they conſent to be bound: Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men do with <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſwap a bargain for the things of the world; they conſent to let go their birth right for a meſs of pottage; they give up their birth right to their Inferiours, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to become a ſlave to their own Servants: That word of the Wiſeman is never more true, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 7. then when men are led Captive by the love of this world: <hi>I have ſeen Servants upon Horſes, and Princes walking as Servants upon the Earth.</hi> Never did <hi>Iſrael</hi> do greater drudgery in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then Carnal, Earthly men do to the world: It makes them riſe early, ſit up late, and eat the bread of ſorrows, and all for a few ſhaddows, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 127. 2. <hi>Earthly men,</hi> (ſays one) <hi>are like Beaſts that are ſet to draw in the Devils Teams, who draw ſin with Cart-ropes, and Iniquity with Cords of Vanity: Iſa.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Peccata facile veniunt, ſed fortiter ligant.</hi>

               <p>Sixthly, Earthly riches are defiling too: The Apoſtle calls riches filthy lucre, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Not for filthy lucre:</hi>

Such men are the greateſt Couzeners in the world, that cheat themſelves, and looſe their Souls for ſublunary treaſures: The Riches of this world defile the Conſciences of thoſe that love them; the Apoſtle calls them the pollutions of the world, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. 'Tis conſiderable that the Pſalmiſt doth uſe the word, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 52. 7. to fignifie both riches and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: <hi>Lo this is the man that made not God his ſtrength, but truſted in the abundance of his Riches,</hi>

Nay, they that will be rich de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of the profit of thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they do enjoy: The Love of the world takes off the good of the word, whiles it is preached to them, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 22. The things of the world damp mens affections to Chriſt, and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48427:192"/> heavenly things; they ſtifle mens Conſciences: It duls and blunts the edge of the Sword of the Goſpel, and makes it rebound back again, when it fals upon the rocky heart, hardned with the love of the World: O they are damnifiing things: And at laſt they will ſet you hard, but they will loſe your Souls, and then you have made a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bargain indeed, when you have loſt your Souls.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They are dangerous and too often damning things; they are dangerous for they keep the Soul from Chriſt: As the young man in the Goſpel, he came to the very laſt ſtep, and yet there he ſtayed, he could not part withall for Chriſt that broke the bargain <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 22. <hi>He went away ſorrowful for he had great poſſeſſions:</hi> The love of the World ſtood in the way of his receiving Chriſt; Thorns are the ſhelter for Serpents and riches for many luſts, that drown men in perdition and deſtruction. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. The word in the original ſignifies a plunging over head and ears in ruine, ſunk to the bottom, as one that hath a great weight upon him: One compares rich men to a Pine Tree of which it is ſaid, that if the bark be pluckt off it will laſt long, but while that abides it rots: riches are as a deep pit, into which men eaſily get, but hardly get out, and therefore Chriſt ſaies. it is eaſier for a Camell to go through the eye of a needle then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 24.</p>
               <p>The things of the World bar up the way to Heaven, and open the way to Hell, and haſten the Soul with a vengeance to deſtruction: They
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48427:193"/> are like the Devils ſleep-drench, that caſts Souls into a deep trance, and 'till they come to the end of their lives they never awake, and then they awake with a vengeance: That's the firſt. Conſider what the things of the world are, and they are fools indeed that purſue them with the neglect of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the different terms on which they are to be had, and it will appear to be folly for men to deſert Heavenly things, and chuſe Earthly: If you would have the World, it will coſt you a great deal of ſorrow, trouble, and pains, you muſt tug hard; <hi>Adam</hi> being turn'd out of Paradiſe muſt work in the ſweat of his brows for his bread. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10. But Heavenly Treaſures is to be received by believing; They come by gift. It is but to come and take it and receive it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly Conſider the caſualty that attends the perſuit of theſe Earthly things. A great deal of caſualty whether you may have them or no; and a great deal of hazard that attends them: The Marchant engages in dangerous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and after all, is not ſure to bring home any treaſure. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Theſe Riches periſh by evil travel:</hi> Suppoſe they are obtained, they ſometimes are waſted aſſoon as won; and he that thinks he hath enough for many years, many times leaves, nothing behind him: Many toyl, and tug, eat out their bowels, and ſpend their days for that which they cannot obtain; how many labour to be rich, and yet dye Poor: <hi>Riches make themſelves wings and flie away. Pro.</hi> 23. 5</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Such as perſue Earthly things with the neglect of Chriſt, contract much guilt upon
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48427:193"/> their own Souls; they violate the whole Law of God; for the whole Law contains ſupream love to God: <hi>Love</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Rom. 13. 10. <hi>And upon this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>hangs all the Law, and the Prophets: Math.</hi> 22. 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon ſupream love to God, and equal love to our neighbour, as to our ſelves: Therefore ſuch as perſue Earthly things, and love the World more then God, they break the whole Law of God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 5. Yea they violate and break the commands of grace alſo: It makes men falſe to all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagments, and promiſes; and to all their civil truſts: O what horrid wickedneſs will not the love of this World put men upon! therefore ſuch contract foul guilt upon their Souls: And this ſhews their folly.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing an uſe of reprehenſion to ſeveral ſorts of Perſons, with conſolation to all ſound Believers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF there be ſuch vaſt and glorious Treaſures in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, opened and tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Goſpel. Then this reprooves ſuch as have or profeſs to have an intereſt in theſe vaſt and boundleſs Treaſures, and yet are ſo little affected with them, and have a low eſtimation of them; O ſad indeed! That the choiceſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48427:194"/> that ever was; boundleſs treaſure, ſhould be eſteemed no more then periſhing traſh. 'Tis a lamentable thing indeed to ſee how moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors value periſhing treaſures ſo much, and Jeſus Chriſt ſo little: Did perſons prize thoſe Heavenly Treaſures, they would have a leſſe eſteem of Earthly; they would be more reſtleſs till they ſaw their Intereſt in them: Purſue more after them; be at more pains and coſt to ſecure them: Be more in the commendation of them, and highly eſteem thoſe that have them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It reproves thoſe that have or ſeem to have a title to this glorious Treaſure, and yet are not contented with it: O Souls, will a few handfuls of duſt pleaſe you, and will not a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Crown, and Glory? Will a little Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the world take up your delight, and will not a Manſion and dwelling-place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſatisfie you? O Believer, hath God made over himſelf, Father, Son, and Spirit to be thine eternal Treaſure, and is not he rich enough to fill all thy heart, and all thy deſires? ſit down and conſider how groundleſs are all thy mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, how unreaſonable are all thy frettings and diſcontent, who canſt ſay of Heaven, <hi>This is mine;</hi> and of God, and Chriſt, <hi>He is mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It reproves thoſe that have or ſeem to have a Title to thoſe treaſures, and yet look after others treaſures, and eagerly purſue a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this World. O unexcuſable! Like <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> they wander after the things of this World, as ſhe did after the people of the Land, till they deflower their Souls: O Chriſtians, have you choſen God, and will you back to the World
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48427:194"/> again? Hath God deliver'd you from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World, and will you yield up your ſelves to it again! Hath grace opened your Priſon Doors, and will you enter in again? Have you taſted God to be gracious, and yet long after the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings bottle, to drink of theſe Waters of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah?</hi> O unreaſonable Souls: How unſutable is this to your ſtate and condition! if you are Saints indeed you are not of this World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. Are you the Citizens of Heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. And would Saints and Angels ſo dig after the World if they come down from Heaven? 'Tis contrary to your promiſes and engagements. You go againſt your convictions, and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by your inordinate love to, and purſuit of the World you are Enemies to God your own and others Souls.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This reproves thoſe of the People of God, who have an intereſt in theſe vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Chriſt, and yet are miſerably poor in their own Souls: Many complain Times be hard, Eſtates waſt, Trades decay, but the greateſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty lies in Spirituals: Faith, Love, Humility, ſelfe denyal, Mortifiedneſs to the World, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are deſtitute of theſe things chiefly; little grace laid out, little grace laid up: Few wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of Spirit in duty, and few works of grace in Mens lives; this argues wonderful Poverty in mens Souls: 'Tis not Poverty in Spirit, but poverty in Spirituals, Profeſſours are ſo guilty of this day; few acts of Piety towards God, few works of charity towards Men: How lean, and ilfavoured are moſt under the Goſpel: Many are learning, and never come to the knowledge
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48427:195"/> of the truth; a ſtrange vail lyes yet upon the minds of many: Little right-kind of knowledge, few know the meaning of the Spirit, few are led into the myſteries of the Goſpel: Others profeſs themſelves wiſe, and to know God, but by works deny him, and their Poverty lies here, They are ful of notions, but empty of holineſs, Earthly and vain in their Spirit: Moſt mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion this day lies in the head; little-heart-god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, little life-holineſs: Little love to God, and Saints: Little fruits brought forth for God, this ſhews the Poverty of the times we live in: Again, the difficultneſs of maintaining Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life; hard to get to a life of faith, and love, hard to keep up hope, this comes from Soul Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: Hard for Perſons to live from one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to another: Spiritual life decays, waſts, languiſhes; 'tis with too many Profeſſours as it is with ancient weak Perſons, that are grown ſo cold, Nature ſo decay'd, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep themſelves warm, longer then by the fire: So tis with many Chriſtians, no longer then under a warming Sermon, but cold preſently; nay 'tis not ordinary Sermons will heat them: The richeſt feedings, the choiceſt Cordials, ſcarce keep up faith, love, and delight in God one moment, and are not theſe poor men? Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions grow, a light, vain, Eearthy, frothy Spirit abounds; but meekneſs, ſavourineſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, gravity, livelyneſs decays: Little ſtrength for duty, hard to hear, pray, or to manage one duty aright; little Spirit and Truth in moſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſervices: Unable to conflict with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, corruptions, oppoſitions: Hard to live
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48427:195"/> up to light, convictions, reſolutions: How do Souls make ſhipwrack of faith, and conſcience! How eaſily are they overcome by their hearts luſt, pride, paſſion, Earthyneſs preſently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them aſide. Unable to bear the leaſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: The very ſhaking of the rod will drive ſome from duty: Perſons cannot yet digeſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and endurings for the Goſpels ſake: How ſoon are many worn out by the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perſecutions of this day: This deſerves ſharp reproof.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It reproves thoſe who partake of thoſe riches of Chriſt, and yet are reſerved to others: O how unlike are theſe to Chriſt! He opens his Treaſures to you, but you ſhut yours from others; he hands out his bounty to you, but you ſhut your eyes from others: His ſtreams make glad the City of God; your narrow heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs makes ſad the Sons of men: His bowels are enlarged, yours ſttaitned; Milk and Honey are under his tongue, emptineſs and vanity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yours; his ſteps drop fatneſs, your hands cauſe leanneſs: O Chriſtians! ſee your unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to Chriſt, and be aſhamed of your ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bowels, and ſhut hands, towards your poor Brethren, whether as to outward or ſpiritual ſupplies! How few are the better for you in ſoul or body, whoſe lips bleſs God for your bounty? <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 13. A cloſe-handed Profeſſor is a Paradox in nature, and differs from God and the whole Creation: The Lord is good and doth good: Jeſus Chriſt aſcended on high, and gives gifts to men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. He is always doing good. The Sun diffuſeth freely of his
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48427:196"/> light, and heat: The clouds drop fatneſs: The Earth brings forth her increaſe; the Trees yield their fruit, and when fit for the uſe of man, lets them fall into their boſomes; the air communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates its refreſhing; the fire its heat, the Sea its ſtore, only man is ſelfiſh and with the unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant hides his talent in a Napkin: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be humbled for your non-conformity to Chriſt, and the little uſe you have made of your Talents, and graces for the good of thoſe you live with.</p>
               <p>Note <hi>That this uſe of Reprehenſion was more fully and largely compos'd by the Author. but the ſubſtance of it is contain'd in that excellent Treatiſe of the Author, call'd</hi> The Heavenly Trade; <hi>to which the Reader is refer'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Conſolation.</p>
               <p>If there be ſuch unſearchable riches in C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riſt for his people: Then here's wonderful Comfort to thoſe that are in Chriſt; ſuch have cauſe to rejoyce and be exceeding glad: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In your intereſt in Chriſt lies your right to all thoſe great and glorious treaſures of Chriſt: He that hath Chriſt, all that is Chriſt's is his: <hi>All things are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. Such are Joynt-Heirs with Chriſt put down in the ſame ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant: adopted to the ſame inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27. They have a Title to all that Chriſt hath as Mediatour, and that by donation and purchaſe: A title that cannot be forfeited nor waſted: A Title to the whole inheritance
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48427:196"/> of God. Ah Believer if Chriſt be thine then 'tis no preſumtion to lay claim to any thing that is his: All that have been treated of him as God-Man Mediatour, his glorious endowments, his perſonal diſpoſitions, and excellent perfections are all thine. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Is not this comfort indeed to believers, that have ſuch a Beloved in Heaven, that is altogether lovely? 'Tis won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful reviving when a Perſon can ſee ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency he is related to beyond what is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: What comfort will a Mother take in a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Child, though her ſelf be deformed? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light will the faithful Wife take in the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of her Husband, and glory in them as her own: Such pleaſure doth the Spouſe take in the beauty of Chriſt. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. And reckons them as her comlineſs though ſhe was black. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>I am black but comely:</hi> What conſolation is this to a child of God to be intitled to ſuch a glorious Jeſus? Though thou art poor yet thy beloved is rich: Though thou art unlovely he is fair, though thou art obſcure and vile, yet he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; and his riches, beauty, and honour are thine; and thy reputation with God, Saints, and Angels ſhall be in him, and as he is. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Who is ſhe that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun.</hi> The Lord Jeſus hath a high account of the Spouſes beauty; ſhe is bright, fair, clear, but it is as the Morning, or Moon, who borrow their beauty from the Sun: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy Heart, O drooping Believer, though thou canſt ſee no worth in thy ſelf, yet thou haſt enough in Chriſt for thee. Again, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Comfort may a Child of God gather from a ſeen Title to all the purchaſe of Chriſt, his
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48427:197"/> Righteouſneſs, Graces, Priviledges, ſure Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Salvation, when he can upon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable grounds lay claim to all this? but ſo the Believer may, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The time is drawing near when they ſhall have a full poſſeſſion of all thoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things:</hi> All thoſe great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things promiſed ſhall be his poſſeſſion, God ſhall be all in all to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. Every tittle of his word ſhall be fulfilled, though Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth paſs away, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 18. Here Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are rich Heirs under age, which differ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from a Servant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. but the day ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens when their great Eſtate will fall into their hands, and they ſhall live upon it to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the expectation of which is cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; when veils ſhall be taken away, and thy ſoul ever with the Lord; when thy filthy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be taken off, and thy beautiful ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ever worn; when thou ſhalt live no more at ſmall allowances of Grace, but receive it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure; thy Table ſpread, thy Cup over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow; thy feeding ſhall be no more on ſent por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from thy Fathers Table, but ſhalt ſit down in his preſence, and feaſt upon his fulneſs to all Eternity: Then ſhall all promiſes be turned into performances; all hopes ſhall end in fruition, and all deſires center in delights, then ſhall parts be turned into perfections, darkneſs into delight, changes into immutabilities, fears into joyes; wants into fulneſs; abſence into preſence: O bleſſed Eternity! When the Lord ſhall bring forth all his Treaſures, open his Ward-robe, and and pay off every ſaved Soul with an infinite ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48427:197"/> as much as he can receive, or deſire to have, treaſures of love in God the Father, Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; rivers of joy in the preſence of God; and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace in conformity to God. Things which eye cannot ſee, nor ear hear, nor the heart of man conceiue. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. And is not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainty of theſe future treaſures ground enough for preſent comfort.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from an intereſt in this rich Jeſus, here's comfort to Saints under all their preſent wants whether outward or inward: In that.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There's enough in Chriſt to ſupply them: <hi>In him dwells the fulneſs of the God-head, Col.</hi> 2. 9. Thy wants Believer are but finite, be they never ſo great; but Chriſts fulneſs is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: Thy neceſſities are the needs of a Creature, his abilitie is the power of a Creator: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt can more eaſily ſupply thy need, then a whole Ocean can fill one pitcher; for betwixt the Creatures there is ſome proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but betwixt God and the Creature none at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As there is enough in Chriſt to fill all thy wants; ſo all the fulneſs that is in Chriſt is thy own, Believer, laid up in Chriſt for thee, made over to thee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Deus mens &amp; omnia mea.</hi> And therefore mayeſt boldly expect ſupplies according to the meaſure of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Dividing to every man ſeverally as he will.</hi> Thou mayeſt as boldly go to the treaſury of Chriſt, as a man doth to his Purſe for money, or to his Cupboard for Bread, and as a Child doth to his Father for neceſſary ſupplies, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 32.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtands engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the wants of his people ſupplied, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 20. <hi>They that fear the Lord ſhall want no good</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:48427:198"/> 
                  <hi>thing,</hi> Phil. 4. 19. <hi>So that thou mayſt boldly ſay the Lord is my helper, Heb.</hi> 13. 6. Doſt thou want Food, Rayment, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for thy Body, or doſt thou want Grace, Wiſdom, Faith, Love, Humility, Patience, Courage, Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, Power over Corruptions, Succour under thy temptations, victory over thy luſt; thou mayſt go to Chriſt with expectations of all that God ſees beſt for thee: ſeeing there are ſuch treaſures of all Grace plac'd and entruſted in Chriſt for thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Comfort under all your loſſes for Chriſt; ſurely if Chriſt be yours, and ſuch vaſt treaſures are in him, he will not ſee you loſers for his ſake; he can and will ſave you harmleſs; nay, requite your expenſive love for him: all that ſtrength of affection, liberty, time, talents (Chriſtians) you lay out for him, ſhall be given in again: Jeſus Chriſt is that good <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane,</hi> who hath paſt his word to repay again whatever is laid out for him, or upon his, at his bidding, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 35. If a tender hearted <hi>Paul</hi> would take the offences of an <hi>Oneſimus</hi> on his account, <hi>Philemon ver.</hi> 18. Much more will Chriſt take the expences for him on his account and repay it a hundred fold in this life, with Glory in that which is to come, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 29.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Comfort under all your reproaches for Chriſt: 'Tis the lot of gracious Souls many times to be accounted vile, and the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of all things by the men of this world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>We are Fools for Chriſts ſake, and deſpiſed:</hi> 'Tis part of the Croſs of Chriſt to be reproach'd for his ſake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. But here's Comfort in ſuch a caſe in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48427:198"/> of thoſe treaſures of Chriſt: Chriſtians, your relation to ſuch a Jeſus who is the Heir of glory will wipe off all your diſgrace: Think on that account you have with God, and the glory you ſhall ſhortly have in your own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and that will ballance all troubles on the account of diſgrace for Chriſt.</p>

               <p>CHriſtians; you that have hopes of an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in theſe treaſures of Chriſt: clear up your title: Be ſure your claim be good: Reſt not till you can have your evidences of Chriſt paſt diſpute, to make the matter plain and certain to you; that you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is yours: Adventure not at all your hopes of ſuch great and glorious things upon uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties: if you miſs and fail in your propriety to this Eſtate, you are undone for ever: There's no repairing the loſs of Chriſt when you come to dye: All your after-wit cannot mend this bad bargain when time is paſt: If you build upon the ſand, till the building time be over, you will have an Eternitie to repent your folly: there's no room for another adventure when the door of Heaven is ſhut: If you have too careleſly, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly laid your hopes of Chriſt, and Glorie, and and ſo are ſecure till the time be paſt, you can

               <p>For the reſolution of this Caſe I ſhall ſpeak to four things.</p>

                  <item>1. How and in what manner a title to Chriſt and thoſe glorious treaſures are to be obtained.</item>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How or in what manner may the ſoul come to have a Right to Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are three uſual ways by which
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48427:199"/> perſons obtain a Title to a thing: 1. By Birth 2. By Purchaſe, 3. By Gift.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By Birth: On this a natural Relation is founded: A Child comes to have a right to his Fathers Inheritance by Birth. This way the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Birth-right fell to the Firſt-born: So <hi>Eſau</hi> had his Title to the Birth-right and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing could he have kept it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 32. So <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> had a right to the Bleſſing, becauſe he was the Firſt-born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another way of obtaining a Title to a thing is by Purchaſe: So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> bought a Field, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 25, Thus men get a Title to Eſtates by Purchaſe, when they part with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable value for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another way of Right to a thing is by Gift and Adoption: So <hi>Jacob</hi> came to an Eſtate in the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the Government of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> the Son-in-Law to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> by gift and Adoption: Theſe are the three uſual ways by which an intereſt is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. By the firſt of theſe man can lay no claim to an intereſt in Chriſt: By Birth we are Children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. By Purchaſe man can never get a claim to Chriſt: There's no buying this Pearl of price. Therefore a Title to Chriſt muſt come the laſt way, by Gift. Faln man having loſt his firſt Eſtate, with all right to life, and capacity to regain it, by fulfilling the terms in order to it, it muſt needs follow, that now if ever he obtain life again it muſt be on a new account, even of Grace. The breach of the firſt Covenant forfeited all, and bound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Offender to death and damnation, till which penalty be removed (which loſt man
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48427:200"/> could never do) there cannot poſſibly be any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe made of new life and Salvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. Sin hath paſſed over all men, and Death by Sin for that all Men have ſinned, and by this fall all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of doing good is loſt. <hi>Rom,</hi> 7. 18. So that now of neceſſity there muſt be a change of the firſt term on which life was to be had, there being no poſſibility in loſt man to fulfill them, and if ever Salvation comes it muſt be by grace <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7. and gift: The new Covenant gives out all his mercies freely, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. There's no place for creature worth and merit in order to Salvation under the Goſpel; he that will be ſaved muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it as a gift: That's the firſt, the way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Chriſt: He is the Fathers gift, and his own gift. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. God gives Chriſt to whom he pleaſeth, not for any diſtinguiſhing worth in the Creature, but from the good pleaſure of his will. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Who are they that obtain Chriſt, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by him?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is they that come to, and receive Chriſt by Faith. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To as many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to them gave he power to become the Sons of God:</hi> Chriſt is offerd in the Goſpel by grace, and is received by faith, the acceptance as offer'd of God is that which intereſts the Soul in him; This is called a comming to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. A letting Chriſt into the heart, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. A believing in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>He that believes in the Son of God hath the witneſs in himſelf:</hi> That is the witneſs of right to Chriſt and life. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>And this is the record God hath given us, Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; and all this in his Son:</hi> For where a gift is freely tendred to all that will receive it, there
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48427:200"/> needs nothing to make that Perſon fit for that gift, but accepting the offer as tenderd to him: Neither doth this acceptance make a Perſon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the gift, but fulfills the terms in order to an Intereſt in it: If a ſum of money be offered to a poor man, and he is called to receive it, this receiving doth not merit it, but appropriate it: So that the Perſons to whom Chriſt is tenderd is to ſinners, to all ſinners, to the chiefeſt of Sinners. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. And to every one of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 37. And the terms on which he is held out is freel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> without money, and without price, and nothing is required to entitle them to this glorious gift, but their receiving it as tendred.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What is neceſſary to the obtaining of Chriſt, and and ſo of thoſe glorious Treaſures in him? Without which Perſons cannot, will not, come to him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are <hi>prerequiſites</hi> to the Souls ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Chriſt: Though they do not merit Chriſt, yet are neceſſary to the receiving of him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Sinner be brought to ſee his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute need of Chriſt, and his everlaſting undone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without him: This courſe the Spirit of God took with <hi>Laodicea. Rev.</hi> 3. 17. And with thoſe Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23, 36. Opens to them their curſed damning Sin, and wretched ſtate by reaſon of ſin, that their hearts might be pricked and wounded. So the Jaylour was this way prepared for Chriſt. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. He was made to ſee his doleful ſtate. Thus the Law is School-Maſter to bring to Chriſt. <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 24. To beat and wound the ſinner that he may ſee his need of a healing Jeſus: Thus the Spirit is promiſed to convince the World of ſin, Righteouſneſs, and Judgment. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. And
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48427:201"/> ſo did God deal with the unconverted under the Goſpel. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another requiſit to the Souls get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this title to Chriſt is this, that there be a knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; his ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſufficiency to ſave, his grace, and real willingneſs to heal, and cure all that come to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. hence, Eternal Life is ſaid to lie in the knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. that is, in the knowledge of his ſufficiencie, and willingneſs to ſave: therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> came to obtain Chriſt in order to it, ſays he: <hi>It pleaſed God to reveal his Son in me, Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16. True faith carries know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with it: Faith is not hoodwinkt and blind, but hath his diſcerning: By faith we come to underſtand: hence the Goſpel is to be preached to every Creature; what is the Goſpel but the opening of Jeſus Chriſt, his ſufficiencie, and willingneſs to ſave ſinners; while perſons lie in a ſtate of ignorance, they cannot come to have a true title to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'Tis neceſſary that the Soul ſee the worth and excellency of Chriſt to ſatisfie: That were there no Heaven at the end; yet Chriſt himſelf were Heaven enough: So <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw an excellencie in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. The Soul that comes to Chriſt, muſt ſee him to be the chiefeſt of ten thouſand; the onely deſirable one, none in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but Chriſt, and none in Earth in compariſon of him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73. 25, He that only eyes Salvation in comming to Chriſt, takes him upon neceſſity, not upon choice.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another requiſite to this comming
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48427:201"/> to Chriſt is that the Soul be brought to a real and actual willigneſs to part with all for him; yea, to a throwing all over board to take him in, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>For whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them dung to win Chriſi.</hi> It was no ſmall ſum theſe Converts parted with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could cloſe with Chriſt, <hi>Acts.</hi> 19. 19. <hi>They brought their Books, and burned them, and counted the price, and found it fifty thouſand pieces of Silver;</hi> which amounts in our money, to one thouſand, five hundred, ſixty and two pounds, and ten ſhillings: hence 'tis ſaid, That he that will be ſaved muſt pluck out his right Eye, and cut off his right Hand <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 29, 30. And the want of which made the Young man go away from Chriſt ſorrowful.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In order to a cloſing with Chriſt 'tis neceſſary that the Soul ſee an utter poverty, and inability in himſelf ever to come to Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt: <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 4. <hi>No man cometh to me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>except the Father, which ſent me, draw him, Joh.</hi> 6. 44. They muſt ſee themſelves poor, that come for ſatisfaction in Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 17. Thou muſt deny thy own Abilities, and Rigteouſneſs, and ſee thy ſelf utterly unable, ſo much as to look to Chriſt, till he give an Eye, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 5.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Soul muſt be brought to cloſe with all the terms of the Goſpel propos'd to him, and made heartily willing to take Chriſt on his own conditions, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 14. A perſon is never fit for Chriſt till he can give him a blank, and bid him write his own terms, unfeignedly ſaying, Lord command me any thing; I ſtick at no propoſals, ſo I may be thine, he that would fain beat down
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48427:202"/> the bargain ſhall never have Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 5. now to ſuch a reception of Chriſt 'tis needful that things be plainly opened, and all the demands of Chriſt be known, and conſidered, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 28. So that there may be a known and hearty conſent to Chriſt, and a full compliance with all his conditions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>What are the certain fruits, and effects of the Souls obtaining Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, That Soul that hath an intereſt in Chriſt is a new Creature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature; old things are paſt away, all things are become new.</hi> As the Lord Chriſt when he was crucifi'd, was laid in a new Tomb; ſo when he is received he muſt be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a new heart: In redemption work all things are new: there's a new Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. A new Mediatour; the firſt Covenant had none, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. Souls are now brought into a new ſtate, of new and glorious Priviledges: They were dead, but now are made alive, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. There's a new Law alſo, the Law of the Goſpel, called the Law of the Spirit of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. Therefore 'tis neceſſarie that the Soul be renewed alſo; this is promis'd under the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17. Behold I create new Heavens, and a new Earth wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs, ſo 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. there will be a wonderful change wrought in that Perſon above what fleſh and blood can do, an inward change a new heart, and a new Spirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. new deſires, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 63. 1. Before the Soul did long after the world, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, vanities; but now, <hi>My Soul breaks for the longing it hath to thy Judgments at all times, Pſ.</hi> 119. 20. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 42. 1, 2. New affections to God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116. 1. new love to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. new love to the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48427:202"/> Law of God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 97, 127. new love to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. new love to the name and glory of God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 26. 12. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 145. 15. new affections for the Croſs of Chriſt, and reproach for his name, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. a new will to loath ſin and cleave to God and Holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 23. a new Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. and they have a new Conveſation, <hi>Rom:</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. They will walk in newneſs of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. They are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to good works to walk in them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. At leaſt, they deſign it, though they fall ſhort of it. Thus a Soul that is come to Chriſt is a new Creature. That Soul that hath no renewings in him, that hath the ſame Spirit, deſires, affections, will, conſcience, that ever he had, cannot prove his intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Soul that hath received Chriſt hath received the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. <hi>for by one Spirit we are all baptiz'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body.</hi> None can receive the Son, but he muſt have the Spirit too; for Chriſt is not divided: He that hath Chriſt, hath the Father and the Spirit, for theſe three are one. Now a Soul that hath the Spirit of Chriſt may know it by the effects of it: The Spirit of Chriſt is a quickening Spirit, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a principle of Life: The Soul that was dead to God, and holineſs; now hath a new life, a heart to move after God: it works from other motives, even from love to God: Doſt thou find thy heart always dead to every act of Grace? No heart to pray, hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is this habitual? O then here's no fruit of Chriſts Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Chriſt is a ſin-oppoſing ſpirit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48427:203"/> quarrelling with Luſt; always convincing, troubling, humbling the Soul for ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. It gives no peaceable poſſeſſion to it, but always oppoſes it as fire doth water: Where the Spirit of Chriſt is, 'tis a leading guiding Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. Chriſtians, what is it leads you? Is it your own Spirits? if you have received the Spirit of God, you may know it by thoſe Scripture ways it takes to put you upon duty: ſuch a one is co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vinced by the word, and perſwaded, and help'd by the word to this and the other duty.</p>
               <p>Again, The Spirit of Chriſt is a praying Spirit: A Soul that is in Chriſt cannot live without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; though no eye ſee it, and no good come by it, yet he cannot omit ſecret prayer, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. 'Tis not enlargement of affections, parts, abilities, and expreſſions in prayer; but the inditings of the Spirit; inward breathings, ſighs and groans of the Spirit: A man may pray like a Saint, or an Angel, and yet not have a jot of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer: but it is the encouragement of the Spirit to wreſtle with God by Chriſt; the inward ſuggeſtions of hope, when a Soul can go to God as to a Father, when the very heart goes out to God in prayer, and when prayer is wing'd with Faith and Love: Theſe are the effects of a Spirit of prayer, and the fruit of a Souls reception of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They that have obtain'd an intereſt in Chriſt, have crucified the fleſh with the luſts there of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. They, and only they that are in Chriſt have crucified the fleſh; that is, the body of death, original ſin: The general Nature of ſin; the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal extents of ſin; come under the workings of this Crucifixtion: O try Souls; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath the Axe been ever laid to the root of ſin? Have you ever
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:48427:203"/> found felling ſtroaks upon the bodie of your Corruptions, are you baptiz'd into the death of Chriſt, and as he died for ſin, ſo do you die to ſin; and by vertue of his death, and wounds, do you fetch power, and ſtrength from him to crucifie it? There's a difference between the curbing; and the crucifying of ſin: ſin may be chain'd up, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, and not crucified: Hypocrites that are under a ſeeming change, do reſtrain, and confine ſin; yea they may puniſh ſin, but do not crucifie it: The crucifying of ſin is the giving it a deadly mortal wound, fetch'd from the blood, and death of Chriſt: Faith fetches vertue from the Grave of Chriſt, to deſtroy the power of ſin, nothing ſo mortally ſtabs this <hi>Leviathan</hi> as a believing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on our propriety in Chriſts Crucifixtion, and a laying hold on promiſes by Faith in order to the application of the benefit of a crucified Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 6. <hi>Our old man is crucified with him:</hi> The putting our luſts into the ſide, wounds, and grave of Chriſt; A levelling the Ax to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin, doth ſtrange work to the crucifying of it. Trie then are your corruptions, Pride, Paſſions, Earthlineſs as ſtrong as ever? deceive not your ſelves, this will never aſſure your intereſt in Chriſt till ſin be deſtroyed: 'tis true, when the wound is given, ſin doth not immediately die, but the bodie of ſin is dying, and the believing Soul finds his corruptions hath leſs ſtrength every day; as a man that loſeth his blood weakens more and more; ſo a Soul that crucifies Luſt, finds it to weaken day by day.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another effect of a Souls union with Chriſt is this: There will be ſome reſemblance of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>As he is ſo are we in this</hi>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:48427:204"/> 
                  <hi>World.</hi> As Chriſt was Crucified in the fleſh, ſo are his Crucified to the fleſh: And as Chriſt was riſen and juſtified in the Spirit, ſo are they ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Spirit, and have the nature, and Image of Chriſt: Hence we are ſaid to be made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Image of his Son. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. They that are Chriſt's are in ſome meaſure of truth like him. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. They have ſomething of Chriſt's Nature, and Spirit: <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus. Phil.</hi> 2. 5. Chriſt's mind was off from, and above the World; and herein lies as great an evidence of intereſt in Chriſt as in any thing, that Soul is dead to, and wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſe from the World. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. Chriſt's mind was heavenly, he favour'd the things above, his meat, and drink was to do his Fathers will, If you are Chriſt's you will be of the ſame mind; nothing in the World will ſo much delight you as to do ſomething for God: Chriſt's mind was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, to do his work, and haſten home; and if you are Chriſt's this will be your mind to diſpatch your work, and haſten home. Chriſt was full of mercy, humility, meekneſs: If you are intereſted in Chriſt, ſo it will be with you.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They that are intereſted in Chriſt, do intereſt Chriſt in themſelves, and in all that is theirs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>They firſt gave themſelves to the Lord:</hi> Such do devote, and make over themſelves, and all to Chriſt, and glad they have any intereſt, parts, capacities, that Chriſt will accept of; they cannot keep back a part; no, were it a thouſand times dearer, Chriſt ſhall have all, <hi>Can.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine:</hi> The keeping back of part loſt <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira;</hi> they were undone, and damned for ever, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. If Chriſt be yours; you will entitle him to all you are and have. And thus are we come to a Concluſion in this matter: That Soul that can come to ſeal to thoſe things, is a happy Soul: O bleſſed Soul indeed! Then mayſt thou boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper; God, Chriſt, the Spirit, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the Kingdom, and glory is mine. Thus much for the uſe of Examination.</p>

                     </gap>itted for Mercy, fill'd with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, devoted to Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. And Heirs of Glory, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. O wonderful, wonderful Grace; this is matter of Praiſes to God to all Eternity: Time would fail to read over your Inventory, and to look through your Treaſury, 'tis Work for an Eternity to do: O believe what you cannot ſee, and admire what you cannot know, and ſtudy out what you yet underſtand not of your bleſſed ſtate, both privative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and poſitively conſider'd, and when you have found out a little of your Happineſs, then look on thoſe beneath you, put your Mercies into the ſcale with the World's Miſeries, rate your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption-intereſt with the lot of Chriſtleſs Souls, matter of the ſame Lump with you, think on your Acquaintance, Friends, Relations, Neighbours, that have enjoyed the ſame Goſpel-Priviledges with you, and yet theſe are left to their Blindneſs, to periſh in the Error of their ways, and muſt down into
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48427:206"/> the deep for ever, but you are exalted, and lifted up to Glory. O! What cauſe is here for Praiſes bleſſings, Thanſgivings, and Hallejuahs to him that ſits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider the greatneſs of that Grace which hath made you to differ; Ah! Believers, Redemption-grace ſaw nothing more in you than in <hi>Judas, Demas,</hi> and thoſe that periſh; you were of the ſame Lump, cut out of the ſame piece, there was not a Jot of Difference between you and the damned, but only the good pleaſure of Grace, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divine Mercy laid it's hand upon you: O that aſtoniſhing word, <hi>becauſe it pleaſed him to make you his people,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. It was only the free grace of God that choſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> and left <hi>Eſau, Rom.</hi> 9. 13. It was not for your ſakes Chriſtians, that the Lot was caſt ſo well for you: No, <hi>Be it known to you O houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>be aſhamed and confounded for ever in your own Eyes,</hi> Ezek. 36. 32. The moving Cauſe, the Wheel within the Wheel, that made you adopted, and others rejected, was only the good Pleaſure of his Will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5. 7. It was from hence, <hi>God ſo loved the World,</hi> out of this Womb ſprung all your Mercies, it was Height of Grace, Length, Breadth, Depth, Love paſſing Knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18. 19. O ye heirs of Glory, be affected, aſtoniſhed, raviſhed with the ſenſe of this rich grace of God towards you, in giving Chriſt not only for you, but to you, and revealing him in you, and uniting him to you by the Spirit, from the ſame Maſs of fallen man, to ſingle out ſome for pardon, and leave others for Puniſhment: O wonderful! The Senſe of this made the Apoſtle break out in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48427:206"/> ſuch a holy Extaſie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God,</hi> O the depth! A note of Exclamation, and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing wonder. O conſider this Love of God to your Souls, 'tis free Love without any Influences from the Creature, full Love without Circumference or Bounds, eternal Love without Beginning and without end. Fruitful Love, abounding in the rich Gifts and Procurements of it, O the Gifts and Tokens God ſends to you now, and O the large ſtore he lays up for ever for you: 'tis ſympathyzing Love, full of Bowels, delighting Love, full of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in you, 'tis reſting Love: He will reſt over them in his Love; 'tis immutable Love without Changes, giving Love, forgiving Love, caring Love, ſecuring Love, returning Love, overcoming Love. O! where ſhall I make an end? How can you come to the bottom of this Deep, wade a little further, till you have loſt your ſelves in holy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Can you ſee your brave houſes, fine Cloaths, comfortable Relations, and have ſuch high Regards, for theſe, and no more for this Grace of God: O wonder more at this Love.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider how this is the great Deſign of God in this grace, that you ſhould be to his praiſe <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 12. That is the end which God aimed at in Prediſtinating you to Glory, that you might be to the Praiſe of his grace, that his Grace might procure the Manifeſtation of his Praiſe; 'tis not for an Enlargement of his Revenue, or Advancement of his Profit; for man cannot be profitable to God, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 22. or for any addition to his Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above all Praiſe, but that he might receive the Tribute of his own Glory, and the returns of his
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48427:207"/> outgoing Goodneſs: Now if this be the very end why God ſets his love upon you Chriſtians, then you have reaſon to glorifie his Grace, leſt you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to overturn the whole Proj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cts of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Think how delightful Praiſe is to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 31. <hi>This alſo ſhall pleaſe the Lord better than an Oxe or a Bullock that hath Horns and Hoofs.</hi> That is, an Adult, and full grown Beaſt, which is more fit for Sacrifice; as <hi>Rabbi D. Kimohy</hi> notes, a Beaſt was not fit for Sacrifice under two years old; ſo that Praiſe is preferred here above all Sacrifice, as that which God takes moſt delight in of any thing, becauſe this doth moſt honour him to acknowledge him the Author of all Mercy, and God of all Grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 23. <hi>Whoſo offereth Praiſe, glorifieth me,</hi> That is, He doth in a ſingular manner ſhew forth mine Honour, and this is pleaſing to him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, This brings Profit to your own Souls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 23. For 'tis the means and way to obtain the Salvation of God; <hi>Ponit viam aut praeparat viam,</hi> (ſaith one) it opens the way for Salvation to go out to that Soul; this duty of Praiſe will bring you Gain, becauſe it engageth God to give out more Mercy, and it leaves Influences of ſpiritual Good on your own Souls; it puts the heart into a good Frame to love God, and delight in him, and leaves more obligedneſs on the Soul to fear and ſerve God: ſo <hi>David</hi> after that Pſalm of Praiſe to God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. was wonderfully influenced to duty to God, as you may ſee, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 11. and had his Spirit abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweetned to men, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider alſo, how pleaſant this duty of Praiſe is to the Soul it ſelf, it is wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48427:207"/> and abundantly affects, and raviſhes the Heart, to have the ſenſe of divine Mercy in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 1. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, for it is pleaſam, and Praiſe is comely.</hi> O Believers! let me effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you then to the higheſt Acknowledgments of Redemption-grace, and to the utmoſt Praiſes for this rich Jeſus, who hath bleſſed you with all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The high honour the Father puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; He is his Well-beloved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. The object of his Delight, the Exaltation of his right-hand, who hath put all things under his Feet, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8.

                  <p>3dly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt deſerves your high Eſtimation, becauſe he is the Fountain of all thoſe Streams that do make glad your Souls, the Sun of all thoſe Beams, that warm your Hearts, the Author of all thoſe Mercies that do ſupply and delight you; all your Excellencies and the things you moſtly value, are Derivations from his glory; things are ratable as they come from Chriſt, he turns your Water into Wine, ſweetens your bitter Cups, and makes them to overflow, all your graces come from his Fullneſs, he is your Friend, your beſt Friend, your old Friend, your none-ſuch in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25.

                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider the wonderful value the Lord Jeſus Chriſt puts upon you, and let this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to a due valuation of him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Joh. 15. 16. O amazing, wonderful, ſovereign Grace! That the Son of God ſhould ſet his higheſt Regards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on loathſome Dung, ſwept out of door by divine Juſtice, caſt out into the open Field, pityful, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, undone Creatures, that he ſhould account you (Believers) as the Apple of his Eye, who have been as Thorns in his ſide, that he ſhould account you as a Seal on his Heart, who have been ſpears to pierce through his Bowels, that he ſhould value you as the travel of his Soul, the Jewels of his Crown, the Inhabitants of his glorious Preſence to all Eternity, that he ſhould account ſuch ſpotty Worms as you worthy of his Love, his Blood, and his Mediation, deſerving his Boſom, his Kingdom and his Throne: O what ſtrange aſtoniſhing Grace is this! and will you prefer Creatures, and place Relations in your Boſom, and let Chriſt lye out of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48427:209"/> door, O unworthy act indeed! Surely he deſerves your higheſt Eſtimation, O prize Chriſt! prize Chriſt! value him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Above all things in Heaven and Earth, count nothing like him, much leſs above him; ſet him in the uppermoſt Seat, enthrone him in your Heart; Let him ride in that Chariot of yours that is pav'd with Love; Eſteem his Perſon above all Perſons, his Purchaſe above all Purchaſe: his Love above all Affections; his help above all Aſſiſtance: Value him above Father, Mother, Husband, Wife, Friends, Pleaſures, Credit, Riches, or whatever is deareſt to you: Say as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Who is like to thee? Exod.</hi> 15. 11. <hi>Thy Name alone is excellent, thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry above the Heavens.</hi> Eſteem his Precepts above all the Commands of men; His Promiſes, his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, his Comforts, his Ordinances, his People above all: Chriſt, in conjunction with other things, accounts himſelf ſlighted; He muſt be <hi>Aut Caeſar, aut nullus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Prize Chriſt in all; in all Perſons and things, make him the Standard to meaſure the worth of all created Beings by; Reckon things as they carry Chriſt in them: when Satan or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tempt you to a high eſteem of any, Ask them, as Chriſt did, whoſe Superſcription and Image they bear? <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 20. As the Talent of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was of greateſt value, ſo let thy Account be of thoſe things that have the Temple ſtamp upon them, in a Sacred Reflection of Jeſus Chriſt. Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon not much of any thing that hath not <hi>Aliquid Chriſti,</hi> ſomething of Chriſt in it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Prize Chriſt at all times; not only by fits and ſtarts; not when he brings thee Loaves,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48427:209"/> and loads thee with his Favours onely, but alſo when he hides his Face, and holds his Hand, when he ſeems to take no notice of thee: Let Chriſt be thy Sun in the Day-time; let him be thy Diamond in the Night, when all other Lights are gone, and ſhadows of Darkneſs are over thee; let him be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes uppermoſt in thy Account; Think meanly of him at no time; let him lye between thy Breaſts, to ſatiate thee at all times, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 13.</p>

Hence 'tis he calls his People to look to him, and be ſaved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. And on this Belief the Saints reſolved to wait and look for him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 17. O Chriſtians! expect all you need from Chriſt: His ſufficiency to help you, and his willingneſs to ſupply you, are Arguments enough for your Expectation: why ſhould you look to Creatures more than to the Creator? to the Clay, more than to the Potter? to broken Pits, more than to the Fountain? to the Phyſician, more than unto God? Is there not a God in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> why then are your eyes, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, after empty Ciſterns, and things that cannot profit you? Have you choſen Chriſt to be your

O Souls! faſten your eyes on Chriſt; expect all you want from him, as the impotent man did on <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3. 5.

And if ſome glimpſes of the preſence, ſome Illapſes of the love of Chriſt, were enough to theſe Sufferers in the want of all things, O unreaſonable Soul, that thou ſhouldeſt complain, and be diſſatisfyed, who haſt an Intereſt
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48427:210"/> in Chriſt, and ſo much of other things too. O Chriſtian! If Chriſt be thine, let it content thee, for all is thine; his Heart is upon thee, and will not that content thee? He loves thee more than all the World, he will not leave thee, and will not this pleaſe thee? <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. He will care for thee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. Thou ſhalt want no good thing, he will make up the want of creatures with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will ſweeten bitter cups; 'tis but a little while, and he will take thee to himſelf, where Wants, Sufferings, Shame, Reproaches, Griefs, and Sin ſhall trouble thee no more: O then be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed with a ſingle Chriſt, in Heaven he muſt be thy alone Happineſs; there's no Houſe, Land, Husband, Wife, Parent, Children, to make up thy Fullneſs and Bleſſedneſs, there God will be all in all, and is not this God in Chriſt enough now?</p>

There is all that in Chriſt, which thy Heart can deſire, ſtretch thy Longings to the utmoſt, and he is infinitely beyond them; and if he deſerves to be the object of thy Deſires, then of thy Delight, for what is Delight but Deſire in Fruition? He is the only adequate object of Delight: other things are unſutable to a ſpiritual Heart, and cannot pleaſe; empty; and cannot ſatisfie; fading, and cannot laſt; cloying, and ſoon become burdenſome; but God in Chriſt is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Excellency: thoſe things that ſeem moſt dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable in Creatures, are but Derivations from his Excellency, Drops of his Fullneſs, Sips of his Sweetneſs, the impreſs of his Fingers: The precious
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48427:211"/> Ordinances of Chriſt, are but the Galleries in which he walks, the Chariot in which he rides, the Cabinet wherein his Jewels lye, the Ciſterns through which Waters of Life paſs to ſaved ones; and if theſe be ſo pleaſant, O what then is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſhould not Believers then delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall I do to get my Heart to this delight in Chriſt? I find my Affections cold, and my Spirits dead, that I cannot taſte that Sweetneſs in Chriſt, nor take that Pleaſure in the Almighty as I would.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, withdraw your Hearts from all other Delights, this courſe doth the Lord ſet <hi>Iſrael</hi> to get up to a delight in himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. There is no greater Enemy to true delight in God, than a perſons own carnal Pleaſure, and delight in things below God, <hi>Whoredom and new Wine take away the Heart, Hoſ.</hi> 4. 11.

                  <p>Secondly, Reſt not till you have cleared up your Intereſt in Chriſt, and can upon good grounds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him as your peculiar and chief Treaſure better than all the World beſides, and appropiate it to your own Souls, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. 5. This drew the Spouſes Heart to ſo much longing after and ſolace in the Lord Jeſus, even the ſight of his tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Worth beyond all others, and her title to all thoſe Excellencies; 'tis ſeen Intereſt in Chriſt that draws out the Heart after him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 10.

                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:48427:211"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, Be ſatisfy'd about Chriſt's ſpecial love to you, and delight in you, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19. Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about an Intereſt in this love of God, did ſo cool the <hi>Jews</hi> Hearts towards him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 14. <hi>But</hi> Zion <hi>ſaith, the Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me:</hi> From hence they began to ſlack their pace after God, and cryed out, behold what a wearineſs is it, and ſnuffed at it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 14. Suſpition of Chriſts Heart towards you will ſtraiten yours towards him: think well of Chriſt's Heart to you, cheriſh daily a good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Nature, Affection, and Faithfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Beg hard for heart-affecting fights of Chriſt; This ſo enamoured the Spouſes Heart, ſhe ſaw the beauties of her beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 1. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him to be the roſe of <hi>Sharon,</hi> and Lilly of the Vallies, the powrings out of his Name drew her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3.

                  <p>Fifthly, Be much in the conſideration of what Chriſt hath done for you, and beſtowed upon you; this ſo engaged <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Heart to God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 17. and filled <hi>David</hi>'s heart wiih ſuch an Extaſy of Joy in God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 19, 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, You can want no good thing, the God of Glory ſtands bound for your Supplies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 10. <hi>They that ſeek the Lord ſhall want no good thing,</hi> Pſal. 23. 1. <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi> It cannot be, that thoſe who are ſo much intereſted in the Heart, Care, Perſon, and Treaſure of the Lord Chriſt, can be deſtitute; what can you want who are entitled to all good things? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. Who are Heirs of the Promiſes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that concern the Life that now is, and that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. You have a ſurer Title to your Supplies, than they that have moſt of the World in their hands; for God hath laid up, in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, a full Allowance for you, how ſhort ſoever he may ſeem to keep you
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48427:212"/> for a while: the Earth is your Lords, and the Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, and the Cattel on a thouſand Hills, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 10. 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 1. Heaven, and Earth and all things therein, are made over in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant for your uſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You ſhall want or ſuffer no more than infinite Wiſdom, and fatherly Love ſees beſt for you; 'tis impoſſible that divine Purpoſes ſhould be fruſtrated towards you; he that will work will work, and nothing ſhall let, 'tis not Men nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, nor the greateſt injury of time, can deprive you of your Fathers Allowance, and that is upon infinite Wiſdom and good Pleaſure. The Wings and Wheels of Gods Providence over his people, and for them, are full of Eyes within and without, to ſhew the wiſe Care and Providence of God over his, in the worſt of times, and hardeſt condition; and theſe Wheels are moving for your Good, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and God ſees in the darkeſt Providence, what is beſt for you; all his Dealings with his people, are the Fruits of everlaſting Love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. God doth in infinite Wiſdom manage all your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; 'tis not by Chance, or through any inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, any Croſſes or Loſſes befall you, but all is done in wiſe Counſel.</p>
                  <p>3dly, The leſs you have of Creatures, the more will God give you of himſelf, if you be looking to him, and by Faith live upon him. God will admit of no Vacuums towards his people, they can want no good thing; therefore if creature-ſupplies be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, Grace comes in the room; as they ſay, Water will aſcend to prevent a Vacuum, and Grace will deſcend to prevent Emptineſs in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; God comes in the room of creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts:
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48427:213"/> when <hi>Job</hi> was ſtript of all, he had more of the viſions of God, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5. <hi>John</hi> had never more Intimacy with Jeſus Chriſt, than when he was in the barren Iſland of <hi>Patmos,</hi> ſtript of the Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of earthly Comforts; <hi>Elijah</hi> never made a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meal, than when he was driven into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and the Angel was his Cook, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. 8. Ah Believers! you have never better Allowance of God, than when you are cut ſhort in outward things, if you be faithful; therefore you ſhould be quiet under all Straits and Neceſſities in the world. The day we live in is full of Tryals to many a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul, the wants of many may be more than many think of, and 'tis now a time to expect more Maintainings from the hand of God, and from the Spirit of Grace, when outward things are removed; when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was brought into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs where was no ſowing nor reaping, they had their Bread from Heaven, and 'tis God's uſual way, to ſend Meat from his own Table, when the Tables of his Children are empty, I mean, more ſpiritual Communications from himſelf, if they murmur not, but patiently and quietly wait for God's Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Conſider, Believers, 'Tis not long you ſhall be in the way of Wants, or Sufferings: the time is haſtning that will ſet you beyond the reach of offending Providences, nothing ſhall offend you when you get home to your own Country.

And make uſe of this Inheritance for all their Supply and Comfort: Chriſtians, you cannot make too bold with your own, Chriſt and all his Fullneſs is your Intereſt: you may wear out your Welcome with men, and beg too often at fellow-Creatures doors, but you cannot ask too often of free Grace, or take too much of Redemption-treaſures, if you be ſure to refer the Meaſures and time to divine pleaſure. In all your need come to Chriſt for whatever you want, for the Life that now is, and that which is to come; this anſwers the end of the everlaſting Covenant, and the Fathers placing this ſtore in Chriſt, and Chriſt's undertaking the Care, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and Salvation of all that come to him, and this wonderfully pleaſeth Chriſt, and advanceth his mediatory Glory: this alſo keeps up the credit and Reputation of the ways of God in the World, when Strangers ſee Believers rich fare, and what a Sufficiency is laid up in Chriſt for them, that Chriſt maintains his own poor, that they need not go a begging; this commends that State and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where care is taken to prevent wandring

                  <p>Eighthly, Improve your Intereſt in theſe vaſt Treaſures, to the enriching of your own Souls; are there ſuch Riches in Chriſt, and is this Jeſus yours? O then labour to be rich alſo. There are two things which I ſhould preſs you to be rich in, 1. In Grace, 2. In good Works.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, You that have Intereſt in theſe Treaſures of Chriſt, labour to be rich in Grace, be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Truth of Grace, with little Meaſures of Grace, but ſtrive to abound in Grace, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 12. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Grace is the beſt Treaſure, and moſt rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally deſirable for it's ſelf. All other created Beings are conditionally good, ſo far as God ſees them beſt for us, and ſo far as they conduce to the great end of Gods Glory, and our Salvation; but Grace is abſolutely good, becauſe 'tis part of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Image of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Which divine Nature he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. 6. Lies in Faith, Vertue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godlineſs, and Charity. 'Tis abſolutely neceſſary to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of God, and being glorified with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Without Faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God, and without Holineſs no man can ſee God,</hi>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:48427:215"/> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Grace is the beſt Treaſure, becauſe the moſt enduring Treaſure, the moſt potent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it can procure more than all the World can, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 23. <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> Indeed created grace cannot, by way of Merit or Purchaſe, procure any thing but by way of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation and Meekneſs, it brings that which all the World cannot: Grace is Gods high way to Mercy and Peace, being under a Promiſe of Peace; Grace and Peace are uſually twins in gracious Souls, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. Grace can quiet you under Troubles, ſtrengthen you under Weakneſs, guide you under Darkneſs, cheer you under Sufferings, enrich you under Loſſes, and fill you under Wants; again, Gaace is the pureſt Treaſure, earthly Treaſures are as thoſe Cities <hi>Solomon</hi> gave to <hi>Hiram,</hi> a mere <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> and dirty things, defiling the Souls of thoſe that have them, and uſe not them aright; Grace is the moſt pleaſant Treaſure, it doth not burthen thoſe that have it, as earthly things do with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Cares and tormenting Fears. Further, Grace is the beſt Treaſure, in that it will go with the Soul into the other World; all the Riches of this World muſt be left behind, Death puts the Owner and his Intereſt into a winding Sheet; no man's Propriety to theſe out-lives himſelf, the Grave buries all his Relation to theſe things, but Grace never dies, true Holineſs goes with the Soul to glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Labour to be rich in Grace, becauſe if you have but little grace, you will hardly prove the truth of grace, though the leaſt grace is grace, as a drop of Wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r is Water, yet a little grace doth not ſo capacitate a Soul to ſee it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. He
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48427:215"/> that wants this thriving Grace, forgets that he was purged from his old Sins, he cannot remember or make out his ſaving Change, or putting off his old ſtate; little Grace is ever ſceptical, and ſubject to Doubtings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 31, <hi>O thou of little Faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe little grace will hardly carry a Soul through the Temptations, Duties, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the day we live in; theſe are ſome of the laſt times we are fall'n upon, and the laſt times are perillous times, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. This is the Character of theſe times, <hi>Abounding Iniquity, and Decay of Love, Matth.</hi> 24. 12. And therefore a little Grace will not carry a Soul through ſtrong Corruptions; where Sin abounds, Grace muſt abound much more, or elſe the Soul will looſe ground, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. What the Apoſtle ſpeaks there of grace in God, 'tis as true of grace in Saints that muſt abound more than their Sin, or elſe Sin will be too hard for them; Judgment muſt be brought forth to Victory, or elſe the bruiſed Reed will break, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. For this end the Apoſtle adviſeth the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in his time, which were leſs liable to ſuch Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ſhould put on the whole Armor of God, and having done all, to ſtand, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 13.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Elſe you cannot anſwer the ends of grace, and all the Coſt of God about you; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of grace in all the means and helps to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is to further their growth in grace, and to make them abound to all well-pleaſing before God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 2. 4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 13, 14. To whom much is given of them much is required, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48.</p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:48427:216"/>
                  <p> Fifthly, That ſo you may be more like to God, who is rich to all that call upon him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 12. He is rich in Mercy, he hath abounded in the Riches of grace towards all his People, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7, 8. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be Epitomies of Chriſt, and Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of his Excellency, holding forth his Vertues in the World, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 9. There can be no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er glory to a Child of God in this World, than to be like to Chriſt, who is the glory of the Father; but by being rich in Grace, you will much mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Excellency of Chriſt in the World.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, By being rich in grace, you will become more ſerviceable to God and others in your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, you will be able to do more work for God than others. Grace is a Talent, and the more Talents you have, the more Incomes hath God from you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 16, 17. Rich men have lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Capacities to honour God in the World than others have, they can do more, and lay out more for God, and be more ſerviceable for God than others; they can feed the Hungry, and cloath the Naked, and take Out-caſts into their houſes; they can do more to ſupport the intereſt of God, than the poor, and have more Subſtance to honour God with; ſo Souls rich in grace, have larger Abilities to ſerve and honour God with: the more Grace the more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably can they ſerve God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. The more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Services are the more acceptable to God by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. For ſuch the Father chuſeth to ſerve him, who ſerve him in Spirit and Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 12. <hi>And the Daughter of</hi> Tyre <hi>ſhall be there with a Gift, even the rich among the People ſhall entreat thy Favour. Tyre</hi> was a rich place as well as vitious, and yet, there would God have a
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48427:216"/> People, which ſhould honour him with their gifts and large expences for him, and the richer the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the greater will their gifts be; <hi>The rich,</hi> or richeſt, for 'tis the ſuperlative in the <hi>Hebrew, Shall bring Gifts, and entreat thy Favour:</hi> noting, that thoſe who are more ſpiritually rich, are more ſerviceable for, and potent with God through Chriſt: theſe can do more with God, as <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were mentioned above others for their Potency with God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 14. And <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel, Jer.</hi> 15. 1. As men who had larger faith and grace, and ſo greater Intimacy with God than others, and ſuch as could do more. O Chriſtians, labour after more grace, becauſe hereby you may become more ſerviceable for God and others, you may more prevail with God through Chriſt for Mercies for the Nation, and can be more helpful for others to teach, counſel, and comfort them, and have more Gold, Myrrhe and Frankincenſe in your Treaſures to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to, and for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Seaventhly, The more rich you are in grace, the more rich you will be in glory; the more grace you improve for God, the more glory ſhall you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 17. 19. This is the rule of the Lords Procedure in the day of Judgment, he will render to every man according to his work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. Though glorified Souls receive not for their grace, yet they ſhall have according to the Meaſure of their graces, for grace widens the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Mercy for glory. The more Liquor the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel hath, the larger it is; ſo the more grace, the larger is that Soul, and the more capable to take in glory, when grace ſhall be turn'd into glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay, <hi>How may we get more of this ſpiritual Treaſure?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Get your Hearts more engaged to it, Deſires are the Souls Wings, that carry it over all difficulties, to it's beloved Object; this is one Character the Apoſtle gives of rich men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>They are ſuch as will be rich:</hi> They have an earneſt mind, an ardent Deſire to be rich, 'tis a Will and Purpoſe grounded on Counſel and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Chriſtians, this will much further your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining theſe riches of grace, if you once get your Hearts reſolved for them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Labour for a holy skill in managing Chriſtianity to the greateſt Advantage; this makes men thrive when they have the Myſtery of their Art, and are their Crafts Maſters, and underſtand the Rules of their Trade; unskillful perſons are not like to thrive whatever their Employment be, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 7, 8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 13. 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Be diligent in the uſe of all your helps and advantages to Soul-profit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. Take all Opportunities of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Pools ſide, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. They that will be rich in the World, take all Opportunities of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ply Markets and Fairs, and Seaſons of Advantage for their Intereſt, and ſo do Souls that thrive in Spirituals, they are much in waiting on God, they loſe no Seaſons that will bring them in ſome Soul-advantage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 23.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Be ſtill getting in more and more grace from Chriſt, 'tis Chriſt's Treaſures that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches the Soul, he that will be rich muſt buy try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gold of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. The graces of Chriſt are true gold, they will bear the Fire, and hold out in greateſt Tryals: counterfeit grace will be as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Silver when it comes to melting, it will
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48427:217"/> be as Hay and Stubble that periſh in the Fire, but true grace will hold in time of Tryal, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. In this, Gold differs from all other Mettals in that it loſeth nothing by the Fire, but comes forth the more pure; ſo is the grace of Chriſt, 'tis as try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gold, that doth not looſe, but get in the Fire of Affliction and Temptation. Naturaliſts ſay, that Gold is more warm in the night than in the day, ſo true grace cheers the Heart more in the night of Tribulation, than in the day of Proſperity. O Chriſtians! if you will be rich, get in grace from Chriſt, every day, for that is the true <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> or the Souls plenty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Of his Fullneſs have we received Grace for Grace.</hi> Make ſome new Additions to your graces every day, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. What the Heathen ſaid concerning Learning, <hi>Nulla dies ſine Linea,</hi> Let the Chriſtian ſay concerning Grace, <hi>Nulla dies ſine Gratia.</hi> This would be a notable way to Soul-proſperity, to be getting from Chriſt ſome more grace in every Approach to him: as are your Receivings from Chriſt, ſo will your Thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings be; put often the hand of Faith into Chriſts Treaſury, and graſp large Portions of Grace for thy Soul: Faith is the only receiving grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, Joh.</hi> 7. 39. Therefore 'tis called the Subſtance of things hoped for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Faith appropriates to the Believer, the Overtures and Promiſes of grace, and by a ſecret magnetick Vertue derives in from the Fullneſs of grace need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Supplies, Faith dips into the Fountain, and fills the Soul with what it needs.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They that will be rich in grace, muſt be thrifty ſaving Souls, choice of their time, and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48427:218"/> careful that they do not waſt their graces, or looſe the things that they have wrought, 2 <hi>Joh. ve.</hi> 8. So perſons that are thriving in the World, are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of every thing, that nothing be waſte; the ſame Care is needful to ſpiritual Enrichings; Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality will ſoon conſume great Eſtates, he that is not ſaving will never be wealthy: Chriſtians, do not conſume your days as a Tale that is told, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 9. make the moſt of every hour, do your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work every day; a wiſe and faithful Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, would tend much to Soul-flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 16. Spend no words in vain: put Time and Talents to the greateſt Advantage: they got moſt for God and themſelves, who were moſt in the Improvement of their Talents; hold faſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Truths you have received, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 25. That is, keep and retain the Doctrine, preſerve and maintain the practice of thoſe Truths you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Be much in begging grace, be always asking ſome ſpiritual Bleſſing from God, as <hi>Caleb</hi>'s Daughter <hi>Achſah,</hi> Judg. 1. 15. her Father had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her one Bleſſing, and ſhe asks another, and 'tis ſaid, he gave the upper and the nether Springs; ſo be not content with what you have, but ſtill be craving for more grace: like Princes Favourites who have their Lords Ear, will be often begging, now this place, then that Preferment; ſo Believers be ſuing hard for Grace, ply the Throne of Grace dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, looſe no Opportunity wherein you may further your ſpiritual Intereſt by Supplication; this is Gods appointed way to the obtaining of Mercy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. Follow your Sutes till you obtain, let your chiefeſt Requeſts be for Grace, and be reſtleſs till
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48427:218"/> you prevail, like <hi>Jacob,</hi> who would not let God go till he had bleſt him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 7. Give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh and make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Praiſe of the Earth. Never leave begging till the Lord Jeſus hath left off giving, and that will not be whilſt he ſits upon the Throne, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Maintain conſtant, intimate, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal walks with God: He is the moſt thriving Soul that keeps neareſt to God; as that is the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ground that is neareſt the warm Sun, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 18. 4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 14. ſo is it to keep near to God: This was that which exalted <hi>Iſrael</hi> above all Nations, they were a People near to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 14. This made <hi>Enoch</hi> ſo ſoon ripe for Heaven, he was one that walkt with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24. Chriſtians, 'tis not your ſitting under God's ſhadow, will make you thrive, till there be a dew on your Souls, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. 7. Keep much in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, with him is the Fountain of Life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 9. Be alſo conſtant in thy walks with God, not by ſits and flaſhes, but drive a ſteady Trade of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Let thy whole courſe of Life, both in thy Civil and Religious Duties be as one conſtant Walk with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. In your Callings, Relation-Duties, in every ſtate, change, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, keep cloſe to God; this is a notable way to ſpiritual proſperity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 33. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. to 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Improve your Intereſt in Chriſt, towards your inriching in good Works; Labour to be rich towards God, as well as in your own Souls, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 21. 1 <hi>Timothy,</hi> 6. 18. Conſider, Chriſtians, the more you lay out for God, the more are you like to
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:48427:219"/> God, <hi>who giveth us richly all good things,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. And in being rich towards God, you will inrich your own Souls alſo: for he that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. Acts of Mercy and Piety are as good Seed, that ſhall not miſcarry, but ſhall bring forth a ſure crop in glory, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 8, 9.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Ninthly, Live up to your Treaſure, Walk as becomes ſo high a Dignity and Relation to ſo rich a Jeſus, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12. This is but reaſonable, if God hath changed your State, that you ſhould change your Lives; If your Relation be new, then your Converſation ſhould be new alſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. 'Tis an unſutable thing, if God hath inveſted you with new Priviledges, to retain your old Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: You were Slaves to Sin and Satan, but the Son hath made you free; how unbecoming a ſtate of Liberty are Bonds and Fetters? Grace hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you Beauty, and, is it fit you ſhould lye in Aſhes, and wear your Sack-cloth ſtill? Chriſtians, you are arrived to your adult ſtate, and to your manly years, and will you be like Children, and Heirs under age? This is unſutable. How unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming is a carnal Heart to a Spiritual State? Works of Darkneſs to the Day-time? <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12, 13. You were poor, worth nothing, ſtript of all, deſtitute, afflicted, and naked; Redemption-Mercy hath inrich'd you, and once more intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with a glorious Treaſure. O, how unmeet is a low Spirit and ſordid Life now! To live on beggatly Elements, to wear filthy Garments, to ſit in the duſt, and wallow in the mire of your Corruptions, this is moſt unworthy alſo of the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48427:219"/> Grace by which you are advanced. Hath the Lord advanced you to Dignity and Honour, and will you diſgrace the Throne of his Glory, and walk unbecoming his Highneſs and Majeſty? O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, you bring Diſhonour on that King of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you are related to, to live like the Subjects of Satan, and Inhabitants of the lower World: you diſgrace his Family, into which you are adopted, to be heterogeneous to it in your Spirit and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: you diſparage the Table you are admitted to, and the Fare you live upon, to look ſo ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and lean in your Souls, as if the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus kept a bad Houſe, and did not allow meat enough to his Children: O Chriſtians! live as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes your Riches, and glorious ſtate into which Free Grace hath put you. Now, 'tis becoming ſuch a change in your condition;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Not to keep your old Company: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons advanced to high Honour, uſually caſt off their former and obſcure Companions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Perſons ſutable to their Dignity: When <hi>David</hi> was advanced from the Sheepfold to a Crown, he leaves his fellow Shepherds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with Nobles: ſo ſhould you, Chriſtians, have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of Darkneſs, but rather reprove them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. Ye are now fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God, and your Lives ſhould be like thoſe, and your intimate Converſes with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 63. What, a Chriſtian, and yet help on the ungodly in their way, and love them that hate the Lord? ſit with vain Perſons, and maintain Confederacy with <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Remalian</hi>'s ſon? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 6. What a Chriſtian, and look ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48427:220"/> on thy Brethren, and become an Alien to thy Father's Houſe? O how unbecoming is this!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not to wear your old clothes: when <hi>Elijah</hi> was mounting to a new condition of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he left his Mantle behind him, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. 13. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> was advanced to higher dignity, his filthy Garments were taken off, and he was clothed with change of Rayment, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 4, 5. O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians! caſt off your filthy garments, your old ſins, by Repentance, put off Pride, and be clothed with Humility, put off Guilt by Repentance, and put on Chriſt by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Live not on your old fare: When the three Children were brought to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Family, they were called to leave their old Pulſe and Water, and live on the King's Table, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 5. O Chriſtians! Are you taken from your Kindred and Father's Houſe, and brought into the Family of Chriſt; leave then your old Garlick and Onions, your ſtollen Waters and forbidden Fruit, and feed on the King's Table, eat and drink abundantly of his Proviſions, his fineſt Wheat, and Honey out of the Rock of Ages; feaſt on his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fat things, the Bread of his Table, his Word and Ordinances, his hidden Manna; let it be your meat and drink to do his Will.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Do not your old work, caſt off the works of Darkneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. Leave off your old Trade of Sin; and ſerving your former Luſts in your Ignorance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 2. but carry on a new Trade of Godlineſs, and Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Leave your old Language; ſpeak no more the Language of <hi>Aſhdod, Neh.</hi> 13. 24. Let no
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:48427:220"/> filthy Communication drop from your Lips, nor vain Diſcourſes be found among you, but let your Communications be holy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6. Perſons of Honour uſually have their Diſcourſes according to their Greatneſs; not ſo light and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, but more grave and ſtately. O Chriſtians! labour you to live ſo, that more gravity and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs appear in your Language and Carriage.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Drive on new Thoughts and Deſigns: when Perſons are exalted from Obſcurity to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, they will not take up ſuch old Thoughts and Projects: So Chriſtians ſhould now have new Imaginations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. Grace ſhould bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt. Vain thoughts muſt now lodge no more in you, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14.</p>

O Chriſtians! ſet forth the Praiſes of your Beloved, that others may be taken with him: Do all you can to further the Match between the Lord Jeſus and Sinners: Be adviſing your Neighbours to forſake their evil wayes, and come to Chriſt that they may be ſaved: Be calling upon, and ſtirring up your Chriſtleſs Friends, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Children and Servants, to be looking after Chriſt, that they may be delivered from the wrath to come. You ſhould be publiſhing his Praiſes, and commend him to all the World: O,

                  </head>
                  <p>Eleventhly, You that are intereſted in this Rich Chriſt, be exhorted, above all Portions, to get Chriſt to be a Portion to your Children; you know what a Treaſure Chriſt is, you have found him inriching your Souls; when you were as a <hi>Syrian,</hi> ready to periſh, he came in, and took you up; he comforted you with the Wine of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: O, that you would labour to provide this Treaſure for your Children! 'Tis ſtrange to ſee Chriſtians heap up Duſt for their Children, and be ſo careleſs to get Chriſt for them: What if you leave them Houſes and Lands when you are gone, and leave them not Chriſt, what doleful Creatures will they be to all Eternity? Time will conſume your Earthly Treaſures: your Children may out-live their Money and Lands that you may leave them: O, let your chiefeſt Proviſions be for their Souls, do what you can to get Chriſt for them: Some may be poor in the World, and have no Portions to leave them; O, how careful ſhould ſuch be to leave them a Treaſure in the Promiſes, a Portion that will not be ſpent. If you can ſay, as the Martyr, Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> told his Wife, when he came to the Stake, he had no Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to leave her, but a Portion in the Promiſes; and ſurely, if you can leave your Children an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, you leave them the beſt Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But, you will ſay, How might we do this?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Labour to Intereſt them in the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant: Get ſound and ſaving Faith your
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:48427:221"/> ſelves, and that will appropriate new Covenant-Mercies to your Seed, <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy Seed, Gen.</hi> 17. 7. This is God's uſual way to the Heirs of Promiſe. 'Tis true, Gracious Perſons may have Carnal Children; but this is God's way; Labour to have ſincere Faith your ſelves, and then you will leave Covenant-Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for your children.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Get a Treaſure for your Children that will not waſte, by your ſtrong Cries to God for them: Improve the Spirit of Grace and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for them: Pour out ſtrong cries and Tears. Few are like <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Mother, who did daily pour out Tears for the Converſion of her Son: <hi>'Tis impoſſible</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to her) <hi>that a Son of ſo many Prayers can be loſt.</hi> May be you pray too coldly for them. O follow God Day and Night, for your Children! O, skrew your Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations higher! It may be you do not pray ſo fervently, ſo believingly as you ſhould for your Children.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Do all you can to convince them of their undone condition without Chriſt. Don't daub and flatter them with falſe Promiſes; they muſt be born again, or elſe they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Inſtruct them in the knowledge of Chriſt: Be opening, and commending Chriſt to them: ſhew them the neceſſity of Faith, and what the Grace of Faith is: Watch over their Lives; be ſtrict and ſevere in reproving their Sins, that they may be ſound in the Faith.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Lead a holy Converſation before them, that by your Lives you may win them to Jeſus
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:48427:222"/> Chriſt; O your Pride, Paſſion, Carnallity, Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may ſtumble them. Thus do all you can to get a Portion of upper Springs for your Children.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, you that have an Intereſt in theſe rich and glorious Treaſures of Chriſt, long to be with Chriſt, for then you ſhall partake of all his Riches; Here you have but a little to carry you in the way, you have but in part, but when you come home to him, then you ſhall have according to the meaſure he hath purchaſed for you, you ſhall ſee and know, as you are ſeen and known, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, 10, 12. In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there you will have a Treaſure without Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, there you will ſee all his Riches and Glory, and be glorified with his glory, then you will live at the full, you will live upon himſelf, and God will be all in all to your Souls; O Chriſtians! long then to be with Chriſt, there's your Treaſure where your Lord is, your Inheritance is above with the Saints in Light; Chriſt is gone to Heaven, and there are all his Riches: O long then to be fit to go home, to be with Chriſt, that you may partake of all his glory.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I now come to the further ſide of this great deep, I mean to the Concluſion of this Subject; and O that what hath been opened of this glorious Chriſt, may not be in vain; you have heard much of this Tree of Life, God knows what Fruit hath been gathered: a glorious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hath been preſented to your View, and offered to you. O ſee what Advantage you have gained, how dreadful will it be, for any that have heard ſo much of this rich Chriſt, to be found poor at laſt? O it will be ſad for any to dye poor in a <hi>Loadicean</hi>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:48427:222"/> State, <hi>Poor, Blind,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> and to be caſt away. O Sinners conſider this, you that have been woo'd and invited to get this choice, tryed Gold, Chriſt hath pleaded with you, to win your Hearts if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; O take heed you dye not without an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, you will hear all thoſe Truths brought over to you again at the Bar of Chriſt: and all the Counſels and Helps you have had to draw your Hearts to Chriſt, will be then as burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire in your Bones, and as boyling Lead in your Bowels, if you periſh without Chriſt; Therefore take heed, take heed, that this Chriſt become not a ſtumbling Stone, and a Rock of offence to your Souls. And ſuch as are Believers, mind your Duty which hath been opened to you; and O that theſe Truths might be profitable to all. And the Lord give a Bleſſing to it. <hi>Amen.</hi>
